				<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
				<p>
					You will need a supported database server and a php enabled web server, 
					Apache is recommended though many other web servers also work fine. 
					MySQL or PostgreSql are recommended for the database. For email you will 
					also need an IMAP or POP3 email server, IMAP is recommended with php-imap 
					extensions loaded in php. Courier, Cyrus, and UWash are recommended though 
					some others also work, At the time of this witting there are known issues 
					with the Mercury32 IMAP server and it is not recommended. We will not cover 
					the installation and configuration of any of these tools in this document. 
					There are plenty of HOWTOs for them and the standard installation found in 
					most Linux distributions will work fine. It will be assumed from here on 
					out that you have a working MySql, Apache, PHP with at least mysql and 
					imap support, and IMAP.
