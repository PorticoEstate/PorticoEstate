NOTE: Due to a conflict with the LDAP schema of QMail the
	phpgroupware.schema file changed. The UPDATE text file
	explains a method to update you existing phpgw-accounts
	to use the new LDAP schema file.
		
NOTE: Contact backend and schema for accounts and groups
	changed as well. Resulting .schema file for openldap is
	located in this folder ('phpgroupware.schema').
	phpgwcontact.schema, phpgwaccount.schema is obsolete.
	OpenLDAP install instruction is updated. Support for OpenLDAP 1.X
	and iPLANET is not guaranteed.
	
NOTE: 	We are in the process of changing the contacts backend.
	The new contacts backend will only support LDAP contacts
	as a read only version of the phpGroupWare contacts. The
	change will also mean that phpGroupWare will only require
	the inetOrgPerson schema to be loaded.  If you want to use
	LDAP for contacts do not upgrade to 0.9.16 until further
	advised.

NOTE2: This file will be changed very soon. Most of what you see here
       is incomplete for the 0.9.16 branch which is in testing for the ldap
       features that are planned. 29/Oct/2003

This directory contains schema files for use the with various
LDAP servers to which we have access.  Openldap 1.X is very
forgiving, and it is not required to load this schema in all
cases.  Openldap 2.X is less forgiving and requires schema
definitions for all objectclasses and attributes.


Openldap 1.X:

The following are for use with openldap 1.X:
	phpgw.oc.conf	defines the phpgwAccount objectclass
	phpgw.at.conf	defines our special attributes

They should be copied to /etc/openldap and added to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf AFTER other similar include lines:

include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.at.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.at.conf


Openldap 2.X:

The following are for use with openldap 2.X:
	phpgroupware.schema    defines the phpgwAccount objectclass and the attributes
	                                                 the phpgwGroup objectclass and the attributes
	                                                 the phpgwContact objectclass and the attributes

These should be copied to /etc/openldap/schema and added to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf AFTER other similar include lines.  These files
rely on core.schema and cosine.schema at least:

include		/etc/openldap/schema/phpgroupware.schema

The Private Enterprise Code/OID for phpgroupware is 1.3.6.1.4.1.9554,
registered via IANA and assigned on May 16 2001.  This is registered
under the name Clear River Technologies, LLC.


Netscape/iPlanet:

The following are for use with Netscape/iPlanet Directory Server:
	iplanet/phpgw.at.conf	defines our special attributes for accounts
	iplanet/phpgw.oc.conf	defines the phpgwAccount objectclass
	iplanet/phpgwcontact.at.conf	defines our special attributes for contacts
	iplanet/phpgwcontact.oc.conf	defines the phpgwContact objectclass

They should be copied to /usr/netscape/server4/slapd-HOST/config and added to
/usr/netscape/server4/slapd-HOST/config/slapd.conf AFTER other similar
include lines:

include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.at.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.at.conf

Modify the slapd.conf file according to your needs and update the configuration of OpenLDAP:

sudo /etc/init.d/slapd stop
cd /etc/ldap
sudo mv slapd.d slapd.d.bck
sudo mkdir slapd.d
sudo slaptest -f slapd.conf -F slapd.d
sudo chown -R openldap:openldap slapd.d
sudo /etc/init.d/slapd start
