I'm pleased to announce XML-RPC for PHP version 1.1
It's taken two years to get to the this point, but here we are, finally.

This is a bugfix and maintenance relase. No major new features have been added.
All known bugs have been ironed out, unless fixing would have meant breaking
the API.
The code has been tested with PHP 3, 4 and 5, even tough PHP 4 is the main
development platform (and some warnings will be emitted when runnning PHP5).

Notheworthy changes include:

 * do not clash any more with the EPI xmlrpc extension bundled with PHP 4 and 5
 * fixed the unicode/charset problems that have been plaguing the lib for years
 * proper parsing of int and float values prepended with zeroes or the '+' char
 * accept float values in exponential notation
 * configurable http user-agent string
 * use the same timeout on client socket reads as used for connecting
 * more explicative error messages in xmlrpcresponse in many cases
 * much more tolerant parsing of malfprmed http responses from xmlrpc servers
 * fixed memleak that prevented the client to be used in never-ending scripts
 * parse bigger xmlrpc messages without crashing (1MB in size or more)
 * be tolerant to xmlrpc responses generated on public servers that add
   javascript advertising at the end of hosted content
 * the lib generates quite a few less PHP warnings during standard operation

This is the last release that will support PHP 3.
The next release will include better support for PHP 5 and (possibly) a slew of
new features.
