I'm pleased to announce XML-RPC for PHP version 1.0 beta 6. This is the
final beta before the 1.0 release.

It can be downloaded from http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/php.html

Comprehensive documentation is available in the distribution, but you
can also browse it at http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/doc/

New features in this release include:

 * Perl and Python test programs for the demo server
 * Proper fault generation on a non-"200 OK" response from a remote host
 * Bugfixed base64 decoding
 * ISO8601 helper routines for translation to and from UNIX timestamps
 * reorganization of code to allow eventual integration of alternative
   transports

The changelog is available at: http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/ChangeLog.txt

Please test this as hard as possible and report bugs to the XML-RPC PHP
mailing list, of which more details are available at
http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/list.html, or to <xmlrpc@usefulinc.com>.
