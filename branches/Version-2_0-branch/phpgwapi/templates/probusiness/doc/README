   pro|business template set for phpGroupWare

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


The template set probusiness is just another template set for
the phpgroupware. Some parts of the template set may remind
you to the graphical user interface of MS Outlook.

   individual appearance
===================================================
Following modules will have an individual appearance with the
template set probusiness:

- phpgwapi
- preferences
- admin
- addressbook
- notes
- todo
- calendar
- tts
- email

   cascading style sheets 
===================================================

The template set probusiness extensively uses cascading style
sheets. Almost all layout definitions are defined in an external and
separated CSS file.
The appearance of the template set probusiness can easily be
adapted by defining an additional CSS file.

   image types 
===================================================

All images should be in the PNG format without using the alpha
channel functionality - this functionality still is not supported by
Microsoft operating systems.

  javascript
===================================================

The template set probusiness uses javascript to allow a client side
and comfortable interaction by the user.

  tab concept
===================================================

Some input masks of the phpGroupWare were enhanced by using
a tab technique. So the information of the user input mask are
grouped and represented on different tabulator sides.

See the 'trouble ticket system' module for an example.


Have fun with this template set,
