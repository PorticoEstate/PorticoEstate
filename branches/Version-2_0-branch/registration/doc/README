These are quick and simple instructions on how to install and use this app.  The more in depth
ones will follow soon.

First, use setup3 to create your tables.

Next, you will need to create an anonymous account.  Do this by
creating a normal user account with just permissions to the
registration app.

Create a group called 'users', this will be the default group that all
users belong to.  So, you can give and take permissions to an entire
group, instead of every single user.

In main.php, there is a config section towards the top.
	$domain         - Which domain to use out of the header.inc.php file, most will use default
	$template_set   - Template set to use, this allows site to create there own layout

Login as admin user, go to the Administration menu, click on the
Site Configuration link for the registration application. Insert the
anonymous user and password.

You can customize what input the user is asked to enter by logging in as
an admin user, and going to Administration-&gt;Registration-&gt;Manage Fields.
You don't need any fields, but you will need an 'email' field if you wish
to use the Lost Password functions.

Make sure phpgwapi.send is properly configured, i.e. the database
contains something like:

INSERT INTO phpgw_config VALUES ('phpgwapi','smtp_server','localhost');
INSERT INTO phpgw_config VALUES ('phpgwapi','smtp_port','25');

The URI's you can use for linking:

Registration: <a href="http://yoursite.com/registration/" target="_NEW">http://yoursite.com/registration/</a>
Password Retrieval: <a href="http://yoursite.com/registration/main.php?menuaction=registration.boreg.lostpw1" target="_NEW">http://yoursite.com/registration/main.php?menuaction=registration.boreg.lostpw1</a>
