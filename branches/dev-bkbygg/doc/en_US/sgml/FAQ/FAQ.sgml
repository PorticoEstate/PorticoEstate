<question><para>Deselecting an application for a user doesn't seem to restrict their access to that application</para></question>
<answer>
<para>
A user gains access to an application one of two ways, being given access directly, or by belonging to a group that has access.  In order to deny a user access to an application, it must be removed from both the users account, and all the users groups.

<qandaentry>
<question><para>The mail preferences are not updated from the interface "mail preferences"</para></question>
<answer>
<para>
If you are referring to setting the password when using custom email preferences, this is actually a security feature. We do not send the password back to the user as it would still be sent back in plain text. Even though it is displayed with asterisks, it would be in plain text if you view the source html for the page. What we do is check to see if the user entered a value in that field. If so, we take the new password the user enters and encrypt it and save it into the database. This provides for maximum security of user passwords.
</para>

<question><para>My IMAP server logs show many login attempts with garbage usernames, why?</para></question>
<answer>
<para>
At this time we know this happens when you enter "localhost" for your POP/IMAP mail server hostname or IP address.  For now the solution would be to try the actual IP or the machine name (resolvable via DNS, hosts, or other means) for your IMAP email server.

<question><para>I can not attach files to an email, I get errors about "unlink"</para></question>
<answer>
<para>
There are two possible causes for this problem, the first and least likely is the web server temp directory, check your webserver configuration for this.  The second is the temp directory which phpGroupWare uses.  To check this, follow these steps:
</para>
<blockquote><literallayout>
- go to http://your.server/phpgroupware/setup  (the phpgroupware initial setup page)
- login to "Setup/Config Admin Log"
- in "Step 2 - Configuration" click "Edit Current Configuration"
- under "Path Information" see the box labeled "Enter full path for temporary files: Examples: /tmp, C:\TEMP"
- Make sure that directory listed has permissions thar are at least 0700 and the owner is nobody.nobody (note: this assumes your webserver runs as user nobody, adjust for your installation) 
- The other directory to check is the temporary directory that your web server typically uses, but the information listed above is by far the most common config issue with email attachments.

<qandadiv> <title>File Manager</title>
<qandaentry>
<question><para>File Manager not working</para></question>
<answer>
<para>
To use the filemanager app:
</para>
<blockquote><literallayout>
(from phpgroupware home)
<userinput># mkdir files</userinput>
<userinput># mkdir files/groups</userinput>
<userinput># mkdir files/users</userinput>
<userinput># chown -R nobody.nobody files</userinput> (note: this assumes your webserver runs as user nobody, adjust for your installation)
<userinput># chmod -R 770 files</userinput>
</literallayout></blockquote>
<para>
Make sure you have the correct FULL path in setup (ie. /home/httpd/phpgroupware/files)
</para>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>index.php not loaded automatically by apache</para></question>
<answer>
<para>
Sometimes /forum/index.php is not loaded automatically by apache, this appears to be a bug in apache 1.3.13mdk.  If you have the same problem just add /index.php in lines 49, 57 and 82 of preference_category.php.

<question><para>Why don't you just use the session class from phplib? Why not use cookies to hold the sessionid?</para></question>
<answer><para>
I personally don't like using cookies for something like this.  However, the session management is currently being abstracted for the applications. This means that switching to cookies will be possible for those that are interested.
