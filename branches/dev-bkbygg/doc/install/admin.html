				<h2>Administration</h2>
				<p>
					Now go to your phpgroupware root in the browser, mine 
					is <a href="#">http://server/~chris/phpgroupware/</a>.
					Login as your admin user. You will have the default "Verdilak" 
					template and a purple color theme. you can change this in 
					Preferences (link on the top right). On the preferences pages as 
					Admin you can select the Default or Forced preferences. Default 
					only applies to new users but lets them change it later, and 
					Forced will change any existing users too and disables the ability 
					to change it. In these default and forced prefs if you leave an 
					option as "Select One" or leave it blank, the system default will 
					apply and the users will be allowed to change that option. Go 
					ahead and find which template you like for a default by selecting 
					one under Your Preferences then set it to be the default or force 
					it. Note that if you choose Idsociety template it looks best with 
					the Idsociety theme.
				</p>
				<p>
					By default the only app granted access to is the Administration app. 
					Using this app you can change some site settings without using the 
					setup app, manage users and groups and installed applications, 
					and other things. Let's edit User accounts and edit our Admin user. 
					If you leave the password fields blank the current password will not 
					be changed. To demonstrate how user and group application permissions 
					work, make sure your user is in both Default and Admin groups, leave 
					Administration checked,	and check only System Information. Any app 
					you grant access to will not show up until you do any one other thing. 
					This is because the menu list is built before the admin apps runs to 
					save the changes.  System Information does not have a menu icon. 
					It's only accessible through the admin app. Now go into User Groups 
					and edit the Admin group. Select Messenger. Now edit the Default 
					group. you will notice the Messenger icon in your menu now. Give 
					the default group access to Addressbook, Calendar, Notify Window, 
					Preferences, User Manual, E-Mail, filemanager, and To Do List. Now 
					submit your changes and	edit the default group again. Click the 
					little blue box in the ACL column next to To Do and a new 
					window will open. Here you can use the ACL to grant permissions 
					to users data for other users. Grant Read, Add and Edit for Admins 
					and only Read for Default. Users will also have access to this tool 
					through the Preferences for Apps that support it so they can grant 
					even more granular access. Submit and close the window. Go back to 
					the Administration app, you now have a section for each of the apps 
					you have rights to use. Go into each one and set anything needed for 
					your installation. To use Email be sure to enter your site settings 
					including an SMTP server. The Email app does not use php's built
					in mail() function nor a local sendmail, it speaks STMP so that it 
					can support more advanced MIME functions like a real email client. 
					Also note here that in order for email to work, your phpgw usernames and 
					passwords MUST be exactly the same as your mail server accounts. If they 
					are not, or you don't want them to be, you will have use the Custom 
					email settings and set it for each user, one at a time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Manual app will give you some insight on how to work each of 
					the apps, but be aware that some of the information is out of date.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hopefully this will give you enough of a start to begin using 
					phpGroupWare for your workgroup needs!
