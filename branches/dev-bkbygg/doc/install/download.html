				<h2>Download and unpack</h2>
				<p>
					There are a few ways to get phpgw, the released tarball from
					<a href="http://download.phpgroupware.org/now">download.phpgroupware.org/now</a> 
					home page, CVS StableBranch and HEAD branches, and most GNU/Linux distros come 
					with a package. It is not recommended to use a distro package because it is 
					almost always out of date and will have bugs due to phpgw still being a 
					BETA project. We will cover installation of a release tarball of 0.9.16.001 
					and a cvs update to get all the latest patches committed to the stable cvs 
					tree. The cvs update is optional but to do it you only need the cvs client 
					installed, most GNU/Linux distributions come with one, and internet access 
					from the server.
				</p>
				<p>
					Grab your preferred packaged format (tar.gz, tar.bz2, or zip) 
					from <a href="http://download.phpgroupware.org/now">download.phpgroupware.org/now</a>
					and save it to a temporary directory. Next extract the archive, I use tar.gz:
				</p>
				<pre>$ tar -zxf phpGroupWare-0.9.16.001.tar.gz</pre>
				<p>
					This will give you a "phpgroupware" directory with lots of directories 
					under it. The phpgw layout is as follows:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dd><tt>phpgroupware\ </tt></dd>
					<dd><tt>|-- App 1\ </tt> (this is the root of an application)</dd>
					<dd><tt>| |-- inc\ </tt> (the applications classes and core files go here)</dd>
					<dd><tt>| |-- setup\ </tt> (the files needed to "install" the app go here)</dd>
					<dd><tt>| |-- templates\ </tt> (the app specific template and theme files go here)</dd>
					<dd><tt>|-- App 2\ </tt> </dd>
					<dd><tt>| |-- inc\ </tt> </dd>
					<dd><tt>| |-- setup\ </tt> </dd>
					<dd><tt>| |-- templates\ </tt> </dd>
					<dd><tt>.</tt></dd>
					<dd><tt>.</tt></dd>
					<dd><tt>.</tt></dd>
					<dd>and so on</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>
					Next move the phpgroupware directory into your web root. There is no formula 
					for where to put it, typically you would put it directly in /var/www/html/ or 
					/home/httpd/html/ or where ever your apache DocumentRoot is.   Alternatively 
					you can install phpGroupWare using a virtual host.  For this HOWTO 
					I will be using my users home directory in /home/chris/htdocs/ and not doing 
					any phpgw config as root. The only requirement is that every directory in the 
					file system up to the directory you install in MUST have modes a+rx or 755 
					so that the anonymous web user can view the html and run the php scripts. 
					The php files do not have to be executable unless you are using the php CGI,
					which is not recommended for a php application of this size and complexity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before we start installing, we'll get the latest patches from the phpgroupware 
					stable CVS tree. The package you downloaded will already have the CVS directories 
					in it to tell the cvs client what to do. This step is optional but highly 
					recommended. Run the following command anytime you want to get the latest 
					patches from the stable cvs tree.
				</p>
				<pre>
			$ export CVS_RSH=ssh
			$ cd phpgroupware
			$ cvs -z6 update -dP > cvs.log
				</pre>
				<p>
					You may get a warning about a missing .cvspass file, this is harmless. 
					You will then see cvs go through every directory looking for files to 
					update. This will also create a cvs.log file showing you what files 
					updated. It is recommended you review this log to check for errors after 
					each update.
