				<h2>Tips to increase phpgw response time</h2>
				<p>
					This section is based on user tips for how to increase your server's speed 
					for serving up phpgw pages.
				</p>
				<p>
					This will start out kind of general since phpGroupWare can run on so many 
					hardware platforms with so many combinations of web servers and databases 
					but hopefully people will add more specific tips as time goes by.
				</p>
				<p>
					To add your tip/s please email the 
					<a href="mailto:phpgroupware-docteam@gnu.org">phpGroupWare Documentation Team</a>.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>add more RAM or reduce the amount of other software running on the 
						same machine (X windows on GNU/Linux machines is exceptionally 
						good at using all your RAM). This will likely give you the 
						biggest bang for the effort/cost. By adding more RAM, you can:
						<ul>
							<li>reduce or prevent any memory swaps to the hard drive 
								(a killer for any kind of server)</li>
							<li>increase the cache size so more info is stored in RAM
								<ul>
									<li>php.ini (usually /etc/php.ini on GNU/Linux
										systems) has cache settings</li>
									<li>use a php accelerator (this 
										basically holds php code in a cache 
										so the web server doesn't have to 
										load it each time), the best open source
										php cache is 
										<a href="http://turck-mmcache.sf.net">
										turck</a></li>
									<li>increase database cache size and look ahead
										<ul>
											<li>mysql</li>
											<li>postgresql .. look for the 
												file postgresql.conf</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>turn off IP address lookups and turn 
										on use cookies and php session 
										management in phpgoupware 
										setup, config</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					<li>look for network traffic bottlenecks and handle those with hardware. 
						This is usually only a problem on LANs with a larger user base 
						but would be applicable with a small user base on a 10MB LANs. 
						A relatively small number of concurrent users (20 or so) can eat 
						up a 1.5MB DSL internet connection (additional users could be 
						connected from the LAN at the same time without affecting the 
						internet network connection) so you would want to get a faster 
						connection.</li>
				</ul>

    					This is what I found to be the miminum list of modules that need 
					to be loaded in http.conf for phpGroupWare to run.  Here is the list
					in entry order:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>define_module</li>
					<li>config_log_module</li>
					<li>mime_module</li>
					<li>status_module</li>
					<li>includes_module</li>
					<li>cgi_module # I'm running SQL-Ledger</li>
					<li>alias_module</li>
					<li>access_module</li>
					<li>php4_module</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Editors Note:</b> mod_rewrite is needed for sitemgr,
					mod_dav is needed to use the webdav version of the VFS.
				</p>
				<p>
					This didn't seem to make much difference in page load times. 
					Maybe because there is 1Gb of RAM in the server.

					Where I've found the most impact is in using apache 1.3.26 with 
					<a href="http://www.iagora.com/about/software/lingerd/">lingerd</a>. It
					requires you to patch a vanilla apache thus recompiling php will also be
					a must, as will be putting some new up/down scripts for lingerd. But its
					well worth the trouble, ive seen amazing increases in performance with
					this thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of all the tuning options this is the hardest, but with the least 
					cost (does not require more memmory)
				</p>
				<p>
					Another thing that can have a lot of impact is php cache. Most are incorregible 
					leakers, but ive ran into one called turck that seems to be the smartest in 
					memmory management issues. It will up your perfomance. Anyhow, you should 
					have plenty extra ram for this to show.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, db tunning will also affect the performance. Make sure also
					that you have enough ram and dig into the query cache and indexing
					features of whatever database youre using. Mysql seams the most
					configurable, postgres the least, but it does include a configurable
					query cache size variable somwhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					The more you can get on RAM, the fastest it will all go. Phpgroupware is
					a hungry app, you do need some good tunning or serious iron to run it
					for a larger number of users (300 and up, on less ive seen it can cope
					with it on a 'normal' box -dual 400mhz PII-PRo, scsi 2Gb ram box).

					Here are some server examples:
				</p>
					How can you tell if more RAM would help in GNU/Linux? Run the command line 
					program "top" and look at the memory stats in the upper section. Here's 
					some examples of servers I run:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Server1 - production phpgw/web server:</b><br />
						Mem: 515900K av, 355568K used, 160332K free, 0K shrd, 129264K buff<br />
						Swap: 248968K av, 3492K used, 245476K free 111896K cached<br />
						Not using much swap, plenty of free RAM, good cache and buffer use. 
						This server was started recently and is under a fairly light load.</li>
					<li><b>Server2 - production phpgw/webserver, being phased out and replaced 
						by server1 because it's too slow:</b><br />
						Mem: 261728K av, 252256K used, 9472K free, 0K shrd, 8756K buff<br />
						Swap: 128484K av, 13712K used, 114772K free 84836K cached<br />
						Not too much swap, buffer usage a bit low, very little free 
						RAM (GNU/Linux most always leaves 3-4 meg at all times). This 
						one could do with a more RAM but is holding up OK for now. </li>
					<li><b>Server3 - very light usage phpgw server (2-3 users) and squid server, 
						made of spare parts and no one cares it's slow:</b>
						Mem: 94944K av, 89076K used, 5868K free, 0K shrd, 152K buff<br />
						Swap: 248968K av, 95708K used, 153260K free 18812K cached<br />
						massive swap usage, very very little free mem, almost no buffer usage 
						and very low cached. This server is in pain. You can probably hear 
						it screaming and crying from where you are. This server desperatly 
						needs more RAM (and a faster CPU but that's for another book).</li>
					<li><b>Server 4 - runs everything under the sun including a thin client</b><br />
						CPU states: 0.3% user 0.5% system 0.0% nice 0.0% iowait 99.0% idle<br />
						Mem: 1548224k av, 1528908k used, 19316k free, 0k shrd, 82684k buff
						12k active, 1401180k inactive<br />
						Swap: 500464k av, 32468k used, 467996k free 1203664k cached<br />
						Athlon 2.4 GHz with 1.5 GB of DDR RAM<br />
						15 users with average load of about 5 concurrent<br />
						nice and fast with cranked up cache on phpgw subsystems 
						(apache, php, and postgresql)</li>

				Here are some tips:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Install it on a dedicated server. It is rarely a problem to do that 
				when you use it on a LAN only.</li>
				<li>Stop unused daemons - like sound, samba, cups, telnet or any other
					thing that comes preinstalled in every major GNU/Linux distro lately.</li>
				<li>Reduce the number of Apache instances kept in the server memory.
					The default setting in most distros is 10 Apache instances - way too much
					if you have a dedicated phpGW server with up to 50 users. It is rare
					when more than 2 instances are needed. Also take care about the
					number of mgetty instances - who needs more than 1 virtual console,
					when one always uses ssh?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				So by meeting these guidelines I've managed to set up a Pentium 150MHz with 
				64MB (yeah - sixty four) with apache 1.3, php4, postgresql (mandrake 9 distro) 
				and APC. And it was a perfecty usable phpGW install. The funny thing is that 
				with several users the average swap file usage was about 0 (zero). You know how 
				they say: 640 kb ought to be enough for everyone ;-) Of course it was an 
				experiement, but one should know it is doable and fully usable :-)
