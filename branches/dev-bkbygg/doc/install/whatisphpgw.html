				<h2>What is phpGroupWare?</h2>
				<p>
					phpGroupWare (phpgw) is many things. It is a very flexible pluggable 
					framework capable of hosting applications like a group calendar, Addressbook,
					email, accounting ledger, inventory, and whatever else your can think of. 
					These applications can share a common user store, and a flexible Access 
					Control List (ACL) system to control access and information sharing. At it's 
					core there is the phpgwapi, an API written for php, that provides some very 
					useful functions and tools for developers, including the user store, which has 
					several back ends, database abstraction, and a flexible templating system. 
					Applications are then written using the phpgwapi and phpgw framework to provide 
					web based tools to users. More information can be found at phpGroupWare 
					Applications or our website
