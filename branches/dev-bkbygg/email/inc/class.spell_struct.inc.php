	* EMail - SpellChecking Header Include file
	*
	* Structures shared between Spell Checking and HTML widgets
	* A simple C-Style Include .h file, holds public data structure classes for 
	* class email spell.
	* Class Email Spell can be used with other classess such as the html widget class,
	* however the html widget class, in this example, must be made aware of any data 
	* structures that the spell class may pass to it. Use this file like an include
	* file for such purposes. I suggest require_once.
