Comments by Sigurd sep 2008:

This version of FeLaMiMail is a backport from egroupware.
It depends on libraries that are licensed as version 2.02 of the PHP license
which is illegal to distribute as a part of GPL licensed code.

If you still want to use this version - you have to head over to egroupware and check out egw-pear into
felamimail/inc (nothing to install at setup).

You will need to add the include_path at the top of egw-pear/NET/IMAP.php

set_include_path(PHPGW_SERVER_ROOT.'/felamimail/inc/egw-pear'.PATH_SEPARATOR.get_include_path());

That's it.
