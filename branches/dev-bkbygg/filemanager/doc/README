Module: filemanager
Authors: Jason Wies <zone@phpgroupware.org>, Jonathon Sim <sim@zeald.com> and the team at Zeald

Description: The file manager for phpGroupWare.  Abilities include all common
file actions (upload, mkdir, rename, delete, copy, move), creating and editing
text files, and syncing with the file system.  Per file/directory comments are
stored, and version history is tracked.  Group sharing and ACL are fully
supported.  Files can be stored either as files on the web server, or on a remote WebDAV
repository.  For installation notes see the file INSTALL in this directory - at minimum
you will probably need to set some file permissions.


DEV NOTES
---------
index.php is depreciated by the inc/class.xxphpwebhosting.inc.php files.
index.php is still used in the 0.9.16 release, but all future changes should be
made to the inc/class.xxphpwebhosting.inc.php files in CVS (3-tiered).  This includes
using templates. See the docs in phpgwapi/doc/vfs for more information on
interacting with the VFS (Virtual File System).

There are some simple unit tests in the tests directory : they mainly test the
functionality of the VFS classes.
