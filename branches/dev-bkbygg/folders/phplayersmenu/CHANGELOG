------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 3.1.1 (Nov 15, 2003)
------------------------------------

Eliminated from the code libdir and libjswww, that were no more used.

Fixed a bug in the setTpldirCommon() method.
Changed/extended some parts of code (and updated the examples
accordingly) to allow to change all directory paths using only
the setDirroot() method.
Thanks to Morten Poulsen for his bug report and his suggestion.

Removed the JavaScript tag from lib/layersmenu-browser_detection.js
and updated the examples accordingly.
Thanks to Philipp Kamps for his report.

Changed HTML:default:default with HTML:frames:default in README.PHPDOC
to avoid a warning with phpDocumentor 1.2.2; you have to undo this change
if you are still using phpDocumentor 1.1.

------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 3.1.0 (Sep 21, 2003)
------------------------------------

I wish to start the changelog of this new development branch with
some clarifications about choices I have done with this release.
Recently, I have said many times that I would have eliminated the support
of some old browsers (mainly Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4)
starting from just *this* release; however, I have still not done this
because a middle-ground solution has rather easily allowed to mantain
support for them.
Such middle-ground solution has consisted of reorganizing some stuff,
so that now incompatibility with old browsers is due only to the code
of templates and style sheets, and of providing, beside the default
templates and style sheets, some old-style templates and style sheets
that still allow you to preserve compatibility if you *really* need.
Please consider that this also implies that, to avoid of accidentally
loosing the support of some browsers, now you must be *much more careful*
if you customize templates and style sheets.
Please also consider that probably, starting from now, the old-style
stuff will not be tested as widely and deeply as the new one,
as now the focus is on non-ancient browsers... the need of abandoning
support for Netscape 4, that has disclosed me the world of Internet,
makes me sad, but it's life: time goes on, and too old software
has to be abandoned at a given time.

Upgraded to HTML_Template_PHPLIB-1.3.1.

Reorganized the PHP code to split the classes in more classes:
LayersMenu --> LayersMenuCommon, LayersMenu, TreeMenu
XLayersMenu --> PHPTreeMenu, PlainMenu

Switched to the look anticipated in version 3.0.0 by the NEW_GENERATION
patch; now ancient browsers are no more supported unless you use
old-style templates and style sheets instead of the default ones
(look at example-hormenu-old.php to see an "old-style" example).
Support for Mozilla 0.6 and Netscape 6.0 is available again.
Support of Konqueror 2.1 has been definitively dropped, also
in old-style templates and style sheets.

Added a workaround for the see-through problem, as loudly and longly
requested by many people.
To avail of the workaround, surround the "dangerous" form elements with
a div with id="phplmseethrough" and include layersmenu-see-through.js,
just as in example-see-through.php.
"Dangerous" elements are automatically found relying on the DOM tree
properties; they are not searched for outside the "phplmseethrough" div:
I have chosen this approach for performance and simplicity reasons.
If you do not need this workaround, you do not have to add any such div.
The workaround is available for Konqueror and Internet Explorer 5+.
As Mozilla 1.4 and Opera 7 have solved the problem, I have decided
to avoid any workaround for both Mozilla (that was alredy almost
not affected by this weird problem) and Opera, and I *strongly*
advise Mozilla and Opera users to upgrade to the new versions if possible.
I do not have added any workaround for Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4,
as it seems more difficult (they are both strongly non DOM-compliant)
and as in my opinion it is not worth the effort, also because
in the long term I will drop any support for both them.
On Konqueror 3.x and IE 5+ I have found a reliable way[*] to hide only
elements that actually overlap with popped up layers, but, alas,
on the contrary, since now I have not found a way to check *reliably*
for such overlaps also on Konqueror 2.2, hence the workaround is rather
rough for Konqueror 2.2: each time a layer of the menu is popped up,
*all* "dangerous" form elements are hidden.

[*] According to the performed tests, it *seems* reliable enough ^_^

Changed the name of the "link" field: for better overall coherence,
now it is called "href"; this change affects the DB and the templates
(and the internal code of the classes, but this is not visible to
final users).
Anyway, the API allow to use data put in tables and tables fields
with non default names, hence this change should not cause too many
troubles.

Temporarily dropped the PATCHES directory: the corresponding patches
will be either integrated during this development branch (if it will
appear advisable) or restored later, after needed changes.

Other undocumented changes and improvements to the code.

Be aware that version 3.0 of the manual is not completely suited
to PHPLM 3.1.x and that, in general, version 3.0 of the manual
has to be considered valid only for PHPLM 3.0.x.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 3.0.0 (Aug 31st, 2003)
--------------------------------------

Added and changed many examples; a comprehensive manual has been added,
as loudly and longly requested by many people; the manual is not
bundled with the package, it is released as a separate document.

Added a "Keramik-like" patch based on suggestions and contributions
of Shai Coleman (shai@eurotexte.fr).
This patch is a sort of "preview" of the future versions of PHPLM.
Many thanks, Shai.

Michele Antonecchia has prepared logos and shortcut icons for the
PHP Layers Menu System; they have been added under the LOGOS directory.
Many thanks, Michele.

A minor change to the setTpldir() method; now the default filenames
of templates are updated when the template directory is changed.

A minor bug fix related to a workaround needed for Mozilla < 1.4
for MS Windows.

A minor bug fix to the layersmenu-sub_menu*.ihtml templates (a missing
'colspan="2"').

Fixed an incompatibility with PostgreSQL 7.3 in
lib/layersmenu-process.inc.php

Added some checks to avoid that a new menu is requested before that
its menu menu data are parsed.

Renamed the _parseCommon method as parseCommon, as it can be useful
with the ProcessLayersMenu extended class and hence it has to be
considered a public (not private) method.

Minor changes to README.PHPDOC and to lib/layersmenu*.inc.php to make
things work without warnings with phpDocumentor 1.2.2.

Added CHANGE_TEMPLATE_CLASS_NAME.sh to change the name of the template
class from "Template" to "Template_PHPLIB" (or to something else)
if needed.

Commented out the first "if" statement in the _filename() method
of the Template class, to workaround problems that can arise
due to the buggy and stupid "file system" notation of the MS Windows
environments.

Some minor undocumented changes.

-----------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 3.0beta2 (May 18th, 2003)
-----------------------------------------

Added the timeout feature to the Layers Menu; this feature is enabled
by default; it can be disabled setting
useTimeouts = 0;
in libjs/layersmenu.js; this feature is automatically disabled for
browsers that have troubles with it.
Now the shutdown of all layers onclick is disabled by default; it can
be reenabled setting
shutdownOnClick = 1;
in libjs/layersmenu.js; this feature is automatically enabled for
browsers that either have troubles with the timeout feature or
are not able to use it.
The old behaviour (no timeout, shutdown onclick) is easily restored
setting
useTimeouts = 0;
and
shutdownOnClick = 1;
in libjs/layersmenu.js
Thanks to Paul Adams and Shai Coleman for their suggestions about
this topic.

Some minor changes to the JS Tree Menu and to the PHP Tree Menu
to improve the resulting html code and reduce its size.
Thanks to Stephan Slabihoud for his suggestions.

Added the PATCHES directory to collect some interesting contributed
patches that can be used to change/customize the menu system behaviour.

Added the DOCS directory where documentation has to be added;
currently, it provides only a document about performed tests.

---------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 3.0beta (May 4th, 2003)
---------------------------------------

Split the "lib" directory in "lib" and "libjs"; libdir and libwww
become libdir, libjsdir, libjswww.

Fixed a mistake in lib/layersmenu.inc.php, line 1438 and in
lib/layersmenu-noscript.inc.php, line 175.
Thanks to Stepan Kadlec (steve@students.zcu.cz) for his bug report.

Added the following images for the first item of the Tree Menus:
tree_collapse_first.png
tree_expand_first.png
tree_split_first.png
Thanks to Paulo R. Bagatini (arkanon@ceat.net) for his suggestion.

Minor changes to layersmenu.css to obtain a better look for fonts
with Mozilla 1.3 and Konqueror 3.1 on Mandrake Linux 9.1.

-------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.3.5 (Mar 9th, 2003)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
-------------------------------------

Some little changes to obtain a better imitation of the Gnome, KDE,
and MS Windows main menus' behaviour for the layers menus w.r.t.
turning off popped up layers.
Added setVisibility() and isVisible() to lib/layersmenu-library.js
to extend the browser abstraction layer and to reduce the amount
of browser-dependent code in lib/layersmenu.js

A minor change to moveLayerX() (lib/layersmenu.js) and to getWindowWidth()
(lib/layersmenu-library.js) to handle Netscape 4 just like Mozilla,
as Netscape 4 seems able to return a correct value of the window width.

Renamed popUp() as LMPopUp() and popUpL() as LMPopUpL(), to allow to use
the "popUp" function name (that seems to be rather widely used) for other
purposes in the same page.

Added a workaround to overcome an annoying behaviour of Mozilla on
MS Windows for the layers menus: now layers popped up for the first time
appear on the right place without appearing with abscissa = 0 before.

Added an extended class (ProcessLayersMenu) providing methods useful
to process/convert menus data, e.g. to output a menu structure and
a DB SQL dump corresponding to already parsed data and hence also
to convert a menu structure file to a DB SQL dump and viceversa.
File: lib/layersmenu-process.inc.php
Some examples of use of this extended class have been added to the package.

Added some examples of use of this package.

-------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.3.4 (Mar 2nd, 2003)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
-------------------------------------

Server-side speed improvement: now the depth-first recursive search
of items stored in the DB is performed on a PHP array obtained querying
the DB *only once*; this strongly reduces the time needed to retrieve
and process data stored in the DB.
Thanks to Iacopo Spalletti for this fine suggestion.

Added i18n support for items stored in the DB.
Correspondingly, a non mandatory argument ($language) has been added
to the scanTableForMenu() method.

Improvements for the DB-related user interface.
Now the customization of field names allows to disable not available
(not wanted) fields and should be more comfortable and intuitive and
less error prone.
Now field names can be passed in whatever order and their specification
is mandatory only for non-default field names; not available (not wanted)
fields can be disabled simply passing empty field names.

Added error handling for the DB connection request.

Added $prependedUrl (and the corresponding setPrependedUrl() method)
to the LayersMenu class, to allow to prepend the same string to the
content of all links if needed.
As an example, this is needed if the complete URLs of the links depend
on the settings of the package for which you are using the PHP Layers
Menu System and/or when the storing in the DB of $prependedUrl for each
link item either makes no sense or is not really viable/advisable.

********
* NOTE *
********
Extended the menu structure format to foresee the default expansion state
for each item:
[dots]|[text]|[link]|[title]|[icon]|[target]|[expanded]
The DB dumps have been changed accordingly.
Due to this change, the setTreeMenuDefaultExpansion() method is no more
needed and hence it has been eliminated... now you do not need anymore
to guess the numerical ids of items to be expanded by default ;-)
The corresponding method is still used for the PHP Tree Menu, as this
new approach would be not easily viable in this case and as the default
expansion of the PHP Tree Menu can be easily obtained simply looking
and the URL query string.

Noticeable client-side performance improvement through the use of a
smarter approach in the popUp() function of lib/layersmenu.js
To evidence the difference w.r.t. previous versions, you can compare
versions 2.3.3 and 2.3.4; load the demos of these versions in two
distinct browser tabs (if you are using a browser that *still* does not
provide tabs *nowadays*, you have to load the demos in two distinct
browser windows), then go to the last item of the first horizontal menu
("DOM, layers...") and, when the corresponding layer is popped up,
move the mouse up and down over all the links shown in the layer;
you will notice that switching of highlighting of links backgrounds
now is fast, so much faster w.r.t. version 2.3.3.
(You cannot note any difference if you are using Netscape 4)

********
* NOTE *
********
Some changes to functions and variables names for lib/layersmenu.js,
that has been split in the following way.
-------------------------
lib/layersmenu-library.js
-------------------------
General purpose cross-browser functions, whose code provides a browser
abstraction layer that can be useful also for the development of other
projects.
You do not need anymore to load this code if you want to provide only
JavaScript Tree Menus on your pages.
----------------------
lib/layersmenu.js
----------------------
Code used just by the Layers Menus.
You do not need anymore to load this code if you want to provide only
JavaScript Tree Menus on your pages.
-----------------------------
lib/layerstreemenu-cookies.js
-----------------------------
Code needed to handle cookies for the JavaScript Tree Menus.
You do not need anymore to load this code if you want to provide only
Layer Menus on your pages.
********
* NOTE *
********
Coherently with the above change, the makeHeader() and printHeader()
methods do not provide anymore the browser detection code; include
layersmenu-browser_detection.js in your pages as shown in the examples;
do not include it as you do for layersmenu-library.js, layersmenu.js,
and layerstreemenu-cookies.js; embed it *statically* in your page's code
as in the examples, otherwise you can trigger errors in Netscape 4
if loading of lib/layersmenu-browser_detection.js is completed too late.

Added some simple examples related to the use of items stored in a DB:
example-db-1.php, example-db-2.php, example-db-3.php

A minor change in layersmenu.css to have on Konqueror, for the demo title,
the same look provided by Mozilla.

-------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.3.3 (Feb 9th, 2003)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
-------------------------------------

Minor improvements to the JS Tree Menu code to obtain a correct
behaviour on Konqueror 3.1.

Changes to the JS Tree Menu code to show icons specified for leaf items
in the menu structure.
The images/tree* images have been changed too: now their size is 16x18,
no more 20x18, to match better the size of shortcut icons (16x16).
BTW, 16x18 is just the image size that leads to a perfect imitation
of the "Manage Bookmarks..." window of Mozilla.

Added for the Tree Menus some themes consisting of tarballs of images
that can be used replacing the default ones; available themes
are in the "THEMES" directory: galeon-theme, gmc-theme (the one used
until version 2.3.2), kde-theme, mozilla-theme (the new default one),
nautilus-gnome-theme.

Abandoned the use of tables for the PHP Tree Menu; now it uses exactly
the same tags (layers) used for the JavaScript Tree Menu and it has
*exactly* the same look, also w.r.t. icons specified for leaf items.
This solves also some formatting problems that can occur on Netscape 4
and that seem to be non solvable without abandoning the use of tables.
Please note that Netscape 4 ignores the "white-space: nowrap" CSS
property, hence, if you want to be sure to obtain a correct formatting
also on Netscape 4, you may need to use the tree inside a nowrap
environment, as in the index.php example bundled with the package.
Thanks to Paulo R. Bagatini, that has evidenced the problem.

Minor changes to handle correctly Opera >= 7, which provides a much
better DOM support w.r.t. previous versions.

A minor improvement to sub-menu templates of the layers menu.

Completely switched to XHTML 1.0 Transitional.

Added the possibility to get the menu content from a DB table.
PEAR DB is used to provide independence of the PHP code from the DBMS;
dumps for PostgreSQL and MySQL are bundled with the package together
with demo data dumps, and an example script is provided, too:
example-db.php

Renamed the parseMenuStructure() method as parseStructureForMenu()
hoping that now its name is less misleading ;^)

Changed debian-icon-mini.png, php-bugs-icon-mini.png, and
phplib-logo-mini.png to obtain corresponding 16x16 icons.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.3.2 (Jan 12nd, 2003)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

Some look improvements, especially for the JavaScript Tree Menu
on Netscape 4, IE 4.0, IE 5.0, Opera 5 and 6.
In particular, now the JavaScript Tree Menu is well formatted
on all browsers and, in particular, on Netscape 4.
********
* NOTE *
********
Now two stylesheets are used: layersmenu.css has been split
in layersmenu.css and layerstreemenu.css; layerstreemenu.css
is included with a different syntax (see the demo example, i.e.
index.php) because it has to be used *only* by newer browsers and,
in particular, it must *not* be used by Netscape 4, to avoid the
Tree Menu formatting problems that can be noted on version 2.3.1.

Added support for IE 4.0 to the JavaScript Tree Menu.

Added cookies to the JavaScript Tree Menu to allow the browser
to remember the expansion state of the tree during a browsing session.

-------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.3.1 (Jan 4th, 2003)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
-------------------------------------

Added a JavaScript Tree Menu to the LayersMenu() class, to provide
tree menus that work completely on the client side.
Only browser sufficiently compliant to the DOM are supported, i.e.
Mozilla (and Mozilla-based browsers, such as Galeon and Netscape >= 6),
Konqueror >= 3.0, IE 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0; everything should run rather
well also on Opera 7.
The following browsers are *not* supported, as supporting them is either
not possible at all or really too hard, even though full accessibility
is provided for them: Netscape 4.x, Konqueror 2.x, lynx, links,
Opera 5 and 6, IE 4.0.
Sorry for Netscape 4; my choice of not supporting it for the JavaScript
Tree Menu makes me very sad, also because it has been the browser
that has disclosed me the world of Internet; but, alas, it is time
to begin abandoning it... thank you so much, and goodbye...

Note: due to the addition of the JavaScript Tree Menu, some name changes
have occurred in the code of the PHP Tree Menu, to avoid conflicts.

Now the Tree Menu uses the text label without any link if the link field
is empty in the menu structure.
Added treeMenuImagesType and setTreeMenuImagesType() to the XLayersMenu
class to allow to use image types different from png in the Tree Menu
without changing the code of the class.
Added treeMenuDefaultExpansion and setTreeMenuDefaultExpansion() to the
XLayersMenu class to allow to set which nodes have to be expanded
by default in the Tree Menu.
Thanks to Paulo R. Bagatini <arkanon@ceat.net> for his suggestions.

Fixed the use of "name=" tags in the Tree Menu.

Some undocumented minor changes and code clean up.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.3.0 (Dec 15th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

Dropped support of Mozilla 0.6 and Netscape 6.0; supported versions
are Mozilla >= 0.7 and Netscape >= 6.1.

Dropped support of PHP < 4.1.

Moved to the PEARified version of the PHPLib Template class.

Changed the code to use a PEAR-like syntax:

for the [+] and [-] icons when the http port was not 80.
Thanks to Yves Mettier <ymettier@libertysurf.fr> and
Jesus M. Castagnetto <jmcastagnetto@php.net> for their bug reports
and fixes.

Other undocumented changes and improvements, e.g. to the templates
and to the style sheet.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.2.0 (Oct 13th, 2002)
--------------------------------------

lib/layersmenu-noscript.inc.php3, new_tree_menu():
fixed the detection of the https protocol.
Thanks to Danny Jovica <danny@e-pc.com.au> for his bug report.

----------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.2beta (Sep 29th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
----------------------------------------

Moved the browser detection from lib/layersmenu.js to the body
of the HTML code returned by the PHP parsing.
This change has been needed to avoid JavaScript errors that
on Netscape 4 often occurred loading the page for the first time
(a reload was needed to make things work).
To this end, the browser detection code has been put in a new file,
i.e. lib/layersmenu-browser_detection.js , which is included
by the template lib/layersmenu-header.ijs , and a minor change
to the make_header() method of the LayersMenu class has been needed
in lib/layersmenu.inc.php3 .

Some minor changes to provide compliance with XHTML 1.0 Transitional.
Now PHP Layers Menu is compliant at least with the following DTDs:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

A minor "cosmetic" change in the setX() function in lib/layersmenu.js

A minor change in the yaresizeHandler() function in lib/layersmenu.js

Changed all the Tree Menu images to use all 20x18 images and provide
a better look, especially on Konqueror.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.1.0 (Sep 21st, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

Now the vertical coordinates of links are obtained simply
as DOM properties.
Hence it is no more needed to estimate their coordinates
through the detection of the position of the mouse pointer,
and it is no more necessary to compute and set reasonable
coordinates for the layers (this was needed for browsers
not able to detect the mouse pointer position).
Detection of the position of the mouse pointer is still employed,
but only for Netscape 4, which does not seem able to return
the vertical coordinate of links relying on the DOM tree.
Many thanks to Iacopo Spalletti for this very fine hint,
which strongly improves the behaviour of this menu system.

A clean up in lib/layersmenu.js for the code handling the
document.onmousedown and the document.onclick events.

Changed the default value of $ordinate_margin, that now is 12
and no more 20.

Updated the README and some comments in the code.
Minor corrections to the README.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.0.0 (Sep 15th, 2002)
--------------------------------------

Functions setwidth() and setheight(): the bug fix provided in version
2.0beta3 causes problems to IE 5.5 and IE 6.0, and Mozilla does not
need it in that functions (it needs it only in functions setleft()
and settop()); hence the same code used in version 2.0beta2 has been
restored for that functions.

The bug fix provided in version 2.0beta3 also prevents the menu system
from working on Opera 5; extended functions setleft() and settop()
to handle Opera 5 as a distinct case and use the non-fixed code for it.

Some extensions to lib/layersmenu.js and minor changes to the templates
to obtain also with IE 6.0 a correct behaviour with the long DTD for
HTML 4.01 Transitional.

----------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.0beta3 (Sep 1st, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
----------------------------------------

A bug fix in lib/layersmenu.js (functions setleft(), settop(),
setwidth(), setheight()); now the menu system works also on Mozilla
also with the long DTD for HTML 4.01 Transitional, i.e. with
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
Many thanks to Iacopo Spalletti for this fine bug fix.

Changed the Tree Menu images according to Debian Woody's Gmc and Galeon.

-----------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.0beta2 (Aug 11th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
-----------------------------------------

Fixed some typos.

-----------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 2.0beta (July 28th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
-----------------------------------------

Commented the code of PHP classes according to the PHPDocumentor syntax.

Added the set_separator() method to allow to change the separator,
that by default is still "|".

Added the possibility of commenting out a line in the menu structure
inserting a "#" as the first character of the line, in analogy with
shell scripts.
Thanks to Normando Marcolongo <normando@lugroma.org> for his suggestion.

Some other minor undocumented changes.

Added an extended class to provide menu solutions not requiring
JavaScript, i.e. Tree Menu (based on the Tree Menu 1.1 package
by Bjorge Dijkstra), Plain Menu, and Horizontal Plain Menu.

Slightly changed the menu structure format: added a separator between
dots and text to allow text of links to begin with one or more dots;
now the menu structure format is
[dots]|[text]|[link]|[title]|[icon]|[target]
(obviously, the separator can be different from "|", which is the default,
if the set_separator() method is used).
More precisely, now only the number of chars before the first separator
is counted, hence it is also possible to use chars different from dots,
even though I discommend to do this and I suggest to continue considering
a format that foresees usage of dots.

PHP Layers Menu 1.1.7 (May 26th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

Reorganization and extension of code, data structures, variables names,
and templates.
Clean up of the style sheet.

Added some variables to the class, in particular, dirroot and libdir.
Thanks to Claudio Bandaloukas <rdfm@lugroma.org>
for his bug report.

Added titles to links and support for icons;
this implies a format change for the menu structure, that now is
[dots][text]|[link]|[title]|[icon]|[target]

Now horizontal menus cells can have arbitrary widths.
This allows to save space in the browser window, with menu layers
still correctly placed.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 1.1.6 (May 19th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

Renamed the class as LayersMenu; renamed methods and added some useful
new methods.

Added the possibility of reading each menu structure from a string
instead of from a file; this is useful if, e.g., the menu structure
is returned by some code that retrieves informations from a data base.

Eliminated inclusion of template.inc.php3 from layersmenu.inc.php3;
now template.inc.php3 has to be included by the script that employs
the LayersMenu class.

Moved some files in suited sub directories and added methods to choose
paths and to choose templates for each menu; changed the demo script
to make more evident this change.

Eliminated $abscissa_stepx5, which was not used.

Added the JavaScript variable IE, to indicate *each version* of IE
(>= 4.0); now the IE4 variable indicates *only* version 4 of IE.
Some minor changes to adapt the code to this choice.

Added an elementary error handling.

Other undocumented changes and improvements.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 1.1.5 (May 12th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

Added handling of window resizing.

Better handling of horizontal autorepositioning of layers.

Some little changes to validate as HTML 4.01 Transitional.

Added methods to allow a more clean use of the menu system
in pages using templating.

Other undocumented improvements and changes.

-------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 1.1.4 (May 5th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
-------------------------------------

Added the LICENSE file and changed the license to include the option
of later versions of the GNU LGPL.

Added detection of layers widths (for browsers able to detect them),
and then set the position of each layer just in correspondence
of the "father" layer.

Added detection of the document width and of width and scroll
of the browsing window, and then implemented horizontal
and vertical "autowrap" of menu layers.

Added explicit detection of Konqueror, as Konqueror 3 implements
useful features but sets IE4 = 1 ... AAAAAAAAAARGHHH!!!

Extended Opera detection, as Opera 6 provides useful features
not available or completely unreliable in Opera 5.

Some code cleanups in layermenu.js

Provided methods makeheader() and makefooter() beside printheader()
and printfooter(), to allow the use of the menu system in pages
using templating (now $this->header and $this->footer can be used).

A minor change to README to avoid problems with e-mail addresses
inside the "pre" tag.

Updated README and corrected some typos.

Minor changes to the demo menu structure files to evidence new features.

Minor undocumented changes.

----------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 1.1.3.1 (Apr 14th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
----------------------------------------

Restored popUp calls in leaf node links, they were needed!!!
Thanks to Hanno Saks <hanno@lv.parnu.ee> for his bug report.
Eliminated a spurious tag.
Affected file: layersmenu.inc.php3

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 1.1.3 (Feb 24th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

A better and more reliable choice of the layer identifying
the first level menu both for horizontal and vertical menus.
Now the layer is defined inside a td tag to avoid problems
with menus not left aligned.
New workarounds to cope with IE's oddities related to this choice.
Centered the menu hormenu1 in the demo to make more evident
the effects of the change.

Eliminated the no more useful moveLayerY() call in links belonging
to the first level menu of horizontal menus; consequently added
the call of moveLayers() in popUp() when needed (it results to be needed
if the first submenu popped up belongs to a horizontal menu).

Eliminated from the templates the tags identifying layers,
to avoid accidental removal of tags essential for the menus operation;
now such tags are inserted through the PHP code.

Some speed enhancements obtained minimizing the number of function calls
in moveLayers() and removing unuseful popUp calls in leaf nodes links
(such enhancements can be noted mainly on Mozilla and IE4).

Renamed layersmenu-footer.ihtml as layersmenu-submenu.ihtml
Renamed the printfirstleveltable() method as printfirstlevelmenu()

Minor undocumented changes.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 1.1.2 (Feb 17th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

Extended the set of functions provided in layersmenu.js.
Now the menu system is able to detect itself the position of menus.
Hence it is no more needed to estimate and provide the corresponding
coordinates when defining a menu, and the phplm() and newmenu() calls
are simpler.
Thanks to this ability, a better support is provided for Konqueror.
Support for Netscape 4: version >= 4.07 is required now
(version 4.05 simply crashes).
Delayed the positioning of hidden layers after the page loading
to preserve support of Mozilla < 0.9 and Netscape 6.0; this also
provides a better support for Opera.
Now setwidth() is no more used in layersmenu.inc.php3
(it resulted to be unnecessary); some changes have been made
to layersmenu-footer.ihtml; these changes achieve a better support
for Netscape 6.0 and a better look of layers for the other browsers.

Some changes to provide correct working of the package also if
in php.ini it is set
error_reporting = E_ALL
("error_reporting = 8" in PHP3)
Thanks to Tomas J. Fulopp <Tomi@uia.be> - <tomas.fulopp@skynet.be>
for his bug report.

-------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 1.1.1 (Feb 3rd, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
-------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in the detection of non leaf nodes.
On version 1.1.0, the bug can be evidenced deleting
the last line of layersmenu.txt and realizing that the link
"Find Files" does not pop up the corresponding layer, 
that contains the link "RPM Find". 
In practice, in version 1.1.0, if the last entry of the menu
structure file is the only child of the previous entry,
it is not possible to pop up the corresponding layer.
Thanks to Michele Conte <ceu@libero.it>
for his bug report.

Renamed phplayersmenu.inc.php3 as layersmenu.inc.php3

Documentation fixes.

Minor undocumented changes.

--------------------------------------
PHP Layers Menu 1.1.0 (Jan 13th, 2002)
UNSTABLE BRANCH
--------------------------------------

Object Oriented rewrite of the package.
Now an arbitrary number of vertical and horizontal menus
can be used on the same page, and the package's use should be easier.
