<p>When you first log onto the system, this page will be presented to you. 
<p>The navigation bar at the top will show you the system applications you have. 
	These applications are represented in two formats
<ul>
	<li>Icons (small pictures, representing the function)</li>
	<li>Icons and text (same as icons, but with added text below each icon)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alerts linked to the calendar or to the trouble ticket/todo list, such as birthday or
	priority tasks, will be listed on this page.
<p>When you first login to this system, you may have an alert on this page, stating you need
	to change your password. This can be done in preferences.
<p>If you would like other features that are not in your navigation bar, 
	but are discussed in these howto pages, please contact the systems admin.
