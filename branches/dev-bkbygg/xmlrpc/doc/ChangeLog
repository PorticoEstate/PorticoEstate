	* xmlrpcs.inc: Added \r into return MIME headers for server class

2001-04-25  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* server.php: Added interop suite of methods.

2001-04-24  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* testsuite.php: added in test case for string handling bug.

	* xmlrpc.inc: merged in minor fixes from G Giunta to fix
	noninitialization. Created new method, getval(), which includes
	experimental support for recreating nested arrays, from Giunta and
	Sofer. Fixed string handling bug where characters after </string>
	but before </value> weren't ignored. Added in support for native
	boolean type into xmlrpc_encode (Giunta).

	* xmlrpcs.inc: updated copyright notice

2001-01-15  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* xmlrpc.inc: fixed bug with creation of booleans. Put checks in
	to ensure that numbers were really numeric. Fixed bug with
	non-escaping of dollar signs in strings.

	* testsuite.php: created test suite.

2000-08-26  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* xmlrpcs.inc: added xmlrpc_debugmsg() function which outputs
	debug information in comments inside the return payload XML

	* xmlrpc.inc: merged in some changes from Dan Libby which fix up
	whitespace handling.
	
	* xmlrpcs.inc: added Content-length header on response (bug from
	Jan Varga <varga@utcru.sk>. This means you can no longer print
	during processing

	* xmlrpc.inc: changed ereg_replace to str_replace in several
	places (thanks to Dan Libby <dan@libby.com> for this).

	* xmlrpc.inc: added xmlrpc_encode() and xmlrpc_decode() from Dan
	Libby--these helper routines make it easier to work in native PHP
	data structures.

2000-07-21  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* xmlrpc.inc: added xmlrpc_client::setCredentials method to pass
	in authorization information, and modified sendPayload* methods to
	send this OK. Thanks to Grant Rauscher for the impetus to do this.
	Also, made the client send empty <params></params> if there are no
	parameters set by the user.

	* doc/xmlrpc_php.sgml: updated documentation to reflect recent
	changes
	

2000-07-18  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* server.php: added examples.invertBooleans method to server as a
	useful test method for boolean values.

	* xmlrpc.inc: rearranged the way booleans are handled to fix
	outstanding problems. Fixed calling addScalar() on arrays so it
	works. Finally fixed backslashification issues to remove the
	problem will dollar signs disappearing.

	* booltest.php: really fixed booleans this time.

2000-06-03  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* xmlrpcs.inc: made signature verification more useful - now
	returns what it found was wrong

	* xmlrpc.inc: fixed bug with decoding dateTimes. Also fixed a bug
	which meant a PHP syntax error happened when attempting to receive
	empty arrays or structs. Also fixed bug with booleans always being
	interpreted as 'true'.

	* server.php: Added validator1 suite of tests to test against
	validator.xmlrpc.com
	

2000-05-06  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* released 1.0b6

	* added test.pl and test.py, Perl and Python scripts that exercise
	server.php somewhat (but not a lot)
	
	* added extra fault condition for a non 200 OK response from the
	remote server.

	* added iso8601_encode() and iso8601_decode() to give some support
	for passing dates around. They translate to and from UNIX
	timestamps. Updated documentation accordingly.

	* fixed string backslashification -- was previously a little
	overzealous! new behavior is '\' --> '\\' and '"' -->
	'\"'. Everything else gets left alone.

2000-04-12  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* updated and bugfixed the documentation

	* fixed base 64 encoding to only happen at serialize() time,
	rather than when a base64 value is created. This fixes the double
	encoding bug reported by Nicolay Mausz
	<castor@flying-dog.com>. The same approach ought to be taken with
	encoding XML entities in the data - this is a TODO.

	* integrated further code from Peter Kocks: used his new code for
	send(), adding a second, optional, parameter which is a timeout
	parameter to fsockopen()

1999-10-11  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* added bug fixes from Peter Kocks <peter.kocks@baygate.com>

1999-10-10  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* updated the documentation

1999-10-08  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* added system.* methods and dispatcher, plus documentation

	* fixed bug which meant request::getNumParams was returning an
	incorrect value

	* added signatures into the dispatch map. This BREAKS
	COMPATIBILITY with previous releases of this code

1999-08-18  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* made entity encoding and decoding transparent now on string
	passing.

	* de-globalised the globals in the parse routines, using an
	associative array to hold all parser state $_xh

	* changed default input encoding to be UTF-8 to match expectation

	* separated out parseResponse into parseResponse and
	parseResponseFile so that you can call parseResponse on a string
	if you have one handy

1999-07-20  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Moved documentation into Docbook format

1999-07-19  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Added an echo server into server.php and echotest.php, a client
	which will exercise the new echo routine.

	* Added test for no valid value returned: in this case will now
	throw the error "invalid payload"

	* Added serialize() method to xmlrpcresp to return a string with
	the response serialized as XML

	* Added automatic encoding and decoding for base64 types

	* Added setDebug() method to client to enable HTML output
	debugging in the client

1999-07-08  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Improved XML parse error reporting on the server side to send it
	back in a faultCode packet. expat errors now begin at 100
	
1999-07-07  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Changed the structmem and arraymem methods of xmlrpcval to always
	return xmlrpc vals whether they referred to scalars or complex
	types.
	 
	* Added the server class and demonstrations
       
	* Fixed bugs in the XML parsing and reworked it
