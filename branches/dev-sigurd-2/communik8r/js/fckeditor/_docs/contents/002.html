		<H1>Server Side Integration Guidelines</H1>
		<P>This documet offers some guidelines that must be considered when
			developing&nbsp;server side integration for FCKeditor (alias Server Side
			Integration Pack).</P>
		<P>There a few points of integration that every server side technology should have
			to be completely ready for FCKeditor. These are the main features:</P>
		<UL>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<A href="#FCKeditorCreator">FCKeditor Creator</A>
				<LI>
					<A href="#FileUploadManager">File Upload Manager</A>
				<LI>
					<A href="#FileBrowser">File Browser</A>
				<LI>
					<A href="#Samples">Samples</A>
				<LI>
					<A href="#Documentation">Documentation</A></LI></UL>
		</UL>
		<P>This document will present the basic (minimum) features the integration must
			accomplish to. Any other feature is a welcome surplus. The scope of this
			document is to provide a generic pattern&nbsp;in the way the editor can have a
			homogeneous programming style even throw different languages.</P>
		<HR width="100%" SIZE="1">
		<H2 id="FCKeditorCreator">FCKeditor Creator</H2>
		<P>This is the main integration feature needed. It makes it possible to create an
			instance of FCKeditor in a page using the desired server side language. Object
			oriented programming (OOP) should be used wherever is possible. These are the
			tasks the Integration Pack should propose to the end user programmer:</P>
		<UL>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				Editor Instance Creation
				<LI>
				Configuration and Settings
				<LI>
					Automatic Browser Compatibility Detection:
					<UL>
						<LI>
						Output HTML&nbsp;of the editor IFRAME for compatible browsers.
						<LI>
							Output HTML of a simple TEXTAREA for not compatible browsers.</LI></UL>
				</LI>
			</UL>
		</UL>
		<P>Suppose the editor instance is called "MyEditor". For compatible browser the
			Integration Pack should output HTML like this:</P>
		<code>&lt;div&gt;<BR>
			&lt;input type="hidden" id="<STRONG>MyEditor</STRONG>" name="MyEditor" value="<STRONG><EM>initial
					value (HTML encoded)</EM> </STRONG>"&gt;<BR>
			&lt;input type="hidden" id="<STRONG>MyEditor</STRONG>___Config" value="<STRONG>Key1=Value1&amp;Key2=Value2&amp;...
				<EM>(Key/Value:HTML encoded)</EM></STRONG>"&gt;<BR>
			&lt;iframe id="<STRONG>MyEditor</STRONG>___Frame" src="<STRONG>/FCKeditor/</STRONG>editor/fckeditor.html?InstanceName=<STRONG>MyEditor</STRONG>&amp;Toolbar=<STRONG>Default</STRONG>"
			width="<STRONG>100%</STRONG>" height="<STRONG>200</STRONG>" frameborder="no"
			scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<BR>
			&lt;/div&gt;<BR>
		</code>
		<P>While non compatible browsers should get:</P>
		<code>&lt;div&gt;<BR>
			&lt;textarea name="<STRONG>MyEditor</STRONG>" rows="4" cols="40" style="WIDTH: <STRONG>
				100%</STRONG>; HEIGHT: <STRONG>200px</STRONG>" wrap="virtual"&gt;<STRONG><EM>initial
					value (HTML encoded)</EM></STRONG>&lt;/textarea&gt;<BR>
			&lt;/div&gt;</code>
		<H3>FCKeditor Class</H3>
		<P>The Integration pack should usually offer a main class, called "FCKeditor", in a
			file called "fckeditor.ext" placed in the root of the editor's distribution
			package. To be able to use the class the end user should just include a "link"
			to that file and then easily create an instance of it. Obviously this is the
			common scenario for scripting languages. Other languages should just reflect
			this situation in the better way it's possible.</P>
		<P>This is the basic structure of the FCKeditor Class:</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<div class="classDefinition">
				<P><STRONG>Constructor</STRONG></P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
					<P>FCKeditor( instanceName )</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><STRONG>Properties</STRONG></P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
					<P>InstanceName<BR>
						Width
						<BR>
						Height
						<BR>
						ToolbarSet
						<BR>
						Value
						<BR>
						BasePath</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><STRONG>Collections</STRONG></P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
					<P>Config <EM>(Only if possible to use collections)</EM></P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><STRONG>Methods</STRONG></P>
				<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
					<P>Create()<BR>
						SetConfig( key, value ) <EM>(Only if not possible to use collections)</EM></P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
			</div>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>The implementation should be based on the Javascript implementation (see
			fckeditor.js file). See <A href="../Using%20FCKeditor/Javascript.html">/_documentation/Developers/Using
				FCKeditor/Javascript.html</A> for a complete explanation of the class
			elements.</P>

		<H2 id="FileUploadManager">File Upload Manager</H2>
		<P>[&nbsp;Documentation not yet available&nbsp;]</P>
		<HR width="100%" SIZE="1">
		<H2 id="FileBrowser">File Browser</H2>
		<P>The editor gives the end user the flexibility to create a custom file browser
			that can be integrated on it. This is a powerful feature, because every case is
			a different case and so different and specific problems must be solved. In any
			case, the editor package offers a default implementation of the File Browser so
			the user has a ready to use software without having to develop anything.</P>
		<P>On prior versions, a sample File Browser was available for each server side
			technology the editor was integrated. The problem with that approach is that
			each sample had a different implementation and worked completed different from
			each other. And worst, on some of then it was really poor.</P>
		<P>To solve that problems the actual version offers a <STRONG>unique interface</STRONG>
			that can be used by all server side languages. The interface was developed
			completely on Javascript DHTML and the integration is available by <STRONG>XML</STRONG>.
			In this way the developer that wants to integrate with it doesn't have be
			worried about the presentation layer of it.</P>
		<H3>The Architecture</H3>
		<P>The following graphic shows how the File Browser Integration works:</P>
		<P align="center"><IMG src="002/FileBrowserConnector.gif"></P>
		<P align="left">The "Connector" is the main file to be developed in this case
			regarding the server side integration with the File Browser. The following
			tasks must be done by the Connector:</P>
		<UL>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<DIV align="left">Receive the File Manager requests.</DIV>
				<LI>
					<DIV align="left">Execute operations in the File System, like folder and files
						creations and listings.</DIV>
				<LI>
					<DIV align="left">Build&nbsp;the XML response in the right format and syntax.</DIV>
				<LI>
					<DIV align="left">Receive and handle file uploads from the File Browser.</DIV>
				</LI>
			</UL>
		</UL>
		<H3>The File Browser Requests</H3>
		<P>All requests are simply made by the File Browser using the normal HTTP channel.
			The request info is always passed by QueryString in the URL that reflects the
			following format:</P>
		<code>connector.ext?Command=<STRONG>CommandName</STRONG>&amp;Type=<STRONG>ResourceType</STRONG>&amp;CurrentFolder=<STRONG>FolderPath</STRONG>&amp;ServerPath=<STRONG>ServerPath</STRONG></code>
		<p><STRONG>CommandName</STRONG><BR>
			Is the command the Connector must execute. For now there are three commands
			that must be handled: "GetFolders", "GetFoldersAndFiles" and "CreateFolder".</p>
		<P><STRONG>ResourceType</STRONG><BR>
			The File Browser is used on many parts of the editor, like the Link and Image
			dialog boxes and in the future Flash and Multimedia dialogs.&nbsp;So to
			separate each "Resource Type" the following type names&nbsp;are
			used:&nbsp;"File", "Image", "Flash" and "Media".</P>
		<P><STRONG>FolderPath</STRONG><BR>
			Represents the path of the actual folder visible in the File Browser. This path
			is not the final URL path for that folder, but it is relative to the Resource
			Type folder. The final folder is composed by: "Configured User Files Path" +
			"Resource Type" + "Folder Path". For example, the Folder Path "/Docs/Test/"
			of&nbsp;resources type "Image"&nbsp;could correspond to the following URL path:
			"/UserFiles/Image/Docs/Test/".</P>
		<P>The Folder Path must always begin and finish with a slash ("/").</P>
		<P><STRONG>ServerPath</STRONG><BR>
			Is the path to the root directory for the files handled by the connector. This
			is not the best approach to set the server directory to use but its a option
			the end user can have.</P>
		<P>The developer is encouraged to make available an easy and secure way to
			configure the "Server Path" folder by the end user. For example,&nbsp;for the
			ASP.NET Connector the user can use the global Web.config file to set witch
			folder to use the file. In case of absent configuration the Connector must use
			the "/UserFiles/" folder. The Connector should also automatically create the
			folder in the case it not exists.</P>
		<P>Please try to let any configuration setting to be done outside the editor
			package directory. In this way it is easy to the end user to handle future
			editor updates (just replacing the entire directory with the new version).</P>
		<H3>The Connector Responses</H3>
		<P>All Connector responses have the same base XML structure, like this:</P>
		<code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
			<br>
			&nbsp; &lt;Connector command="<STRONG>RequestedCommandName</STRONG>"
			resourceType="<STRONG> RequestedResourceType</STRONG>"&gt;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;CurrentFolder path="<STRONG>CurrentFolderPath</STRONG>"
			url="<STRONG>CurrentFolderUrl</STRONG>" /&gt;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG>&lt;!-- Here goes all specific command data --&gt;</STRONG>
			<br>
			&lt;/Connector&gt; </code>
		<P>Some important things must be considered when building the response:</P>
		<UL>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				The response encoding must be set to "text/xml".
				<LI>
				The "Cache-Control" HTTP header must be set to "no-cache". This is need because
				the browsers usually cache the requests for XML files and this is not wanted in
				this case.
				<LI>
					The Path and the URL must always start and finish with a slash (/).</LI></UL>
		</UL>
		<H3>The Commands</H3>
		<P>The actual File Browser version&nbsp;has 3 commands that wait for XML responses
			and 1&nbsp;command that wait for HTML:</P>
		<UL>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<STRONG>GetFolders</STRONG>
				(XML): gets the list of the children folders of a folder.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>GetFoldersAndFiles</STRONG>
				(XML): similar to the above command, gets the list of the children folders and
				files of a folder.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>CreateFolder</STRONG>
				(XML): creates a child folder.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>FileUpload</STRONG> (HTML): adds a file in a folder.</LI></UL>
		</UL>
		<P>Sample responses can be found&nbsp;in the&nbsp;"[Docs
			Path]/contents/002/FileBrowserConnectors/SampleResponses" folder.</P>
		<P><STRONG>GetFolders<BR>
			</STRONG>Gets the list of the children folders of a folder.</P>
		<P>Sample Request:</P>
		<code>connector.ext?Command=<STRONG>GetFolders</STRONG>&amp;Type=<STRONG>File</STRONG>&amp;CurrentFolder=<STRONG>/Samples/Docs/</STRONG>

				&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/Files&gt;<BR>
			</STRONG>&lt;/Connector&gt; </CODE>
		<P>The file size&nbsp;must be expressed&nbsp;as KBytes (KB).</P>
		<P><STRONG>CreateFolder<BR>
			</STRONG>Creates a child folder.</P>
		<P>Sample Request:</P>
		<p></p>
		<CODE>connector.ext?Command=<STRONG>CreateFolder</STRONG>&amp;Type=<STRONG>File</STRONG>&amp;CurrentFolder=<STRONG>/Samples/Docs/</STRONG>&amp;NewFolderName=<STRONG>FolderName</STRONG></CODE>
		<P></P>
		<P>Sample Response:</P>
		<CODE>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
			<BR>
			&nbsp; &lt;Connector command="<STRONG>CreateFolder</STRONG>" resourceType="<STRONG>File</STRONG>"&gt;<BR>

			url="<STRONG>/UserFiles/File/Samples/Docs/</STRONG>" /&gt;<BR>
			<STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Error number="0" /&gt;<BR>
			</STRONG>&lt;/Connector&gt; </CODE>
		<P>Possible Error Numbers are:</P>
		<UL>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<STRONG>0</STRONG>
				: No Errors Found. The folder has been created.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>101</STRONG>
				: Folder already exists.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>102</STRONG>
				: Invalid folder name.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>103</STRONG>
				: You have no permissions to create the folder.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>110</STRONG> : Unknown error creating folder.</LI></UL>
		</UL>
		<P><STRONG>FileUpload<BR>
			</STRONG>Adds a file in a folder.</P>
		<P>This is a special command that doesn't require a XML response. A common
			"multipart/form-data" post goes&nbsp;with the request. The posted file is named
			"<STRONG>NewFile</STRONG>".</P>
		<P>In the case a file with the same name already exists, the Connector must
			automatically rename it adding a&nbsp;progressive number&nbsp;suffix. For
			example, if the posted file is named "Test.doc", the names to be used, in
			order, are: "Test(1).doc", "Test(2).doc", Test(3).doc"... and so on.</P>
		<P>Sample Request:</P>
		<CODE>connector.ext?Command=<STRONG>FileUpload</STRONG>&amp;Type=<STRONG>File</STRONG>&amp;CurrentFolder=<STRONG>/Samples/Docs/</STRONG></CODE>
		<P>Sample Response (Simple HTML):</P>
		<CODE>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<BR>
			window.parent.frames['frmUpload'].OnUploadCompleted(<STRONG>0</STRONG>) ;<BR>
			&lt;/script&gt;</CODE>
		<p>The "OnUploadCompleted" is a JavaScript function that is called to expose the
			upload result. The possible values are:</p>
		<UL>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					OnUploadCompleted( <STRONG>0</STRONG>
				) : no errors found on the upload process.
				<LI>
					OnUploadCompleted( <STRONG>201, 'FileName(1).ext'</STRONG>
				) : the file has been uploaded successfully, but it's name has been changed to
				"FileName(1).ext".
				<LI>
					OnUploadCompleted( <STRONG>202</STRONG> ) : invalid file.</LI></UL>
		</UL>
		<H3>Configuring the Connector</H3>
		<P>All connectors available in the editor package can be found at the following
			folder: "editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors". Each server side
			language has its own folder there, with the Connector file inside it. To choose
			witch connector to use, the end-user just go to the configuration file and
			modify the following key (in this case for the Link Dialog box):</P>
		<P>FCKConfig.<STRONG>LinkBrowserURL</STRONG> = FCKConfig.BasePath +
			"filemanager/browser/default/browser.html?Connector=<STRONG>connectors/aspx/connector.aspx</STRONG>"
			;</P>
		<P>The Connector path is relative to the "editor/filemanager/browser/default"
			folder. The user could even written his custom Connector and point the <STRONG>LinkBrowserURL</STRONG>
			to it, like "?Connector=/<STRONG>MyFolder/MyConnector.php</STRONG>" for
			example.</P>
		<HR width="100%" SIZE="1">
		<H2 id="Samples">Samples</H2>
		<P>The easiest way to the end user to understand how to use the editor is to see it
			in action. So it's important to make available samples that clearly show how to
			use it.</P>
		<P>The developers are invited to create samples similar to that available for the
			Javascript Integration Pack. Please take a look at the <STRONG>_samples/html</STRONG>
			folder. All files must be put together in a&nbsp;folder under the _samples
			folder.</P>
		<P>All samples should post the posted data to a single page that shows that data.
			The Javascript integration module use an ASP file, called <STRONG>sampleposteddata.asp</STRONG>,&nbsp;that
			does&nbsp;that (just because it doesn't go on server side). That file can be
			used as a reference for a custom implementation. Please use the same file name,
			like sampleposteddata.ext.</P>
