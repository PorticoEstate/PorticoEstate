		<H1>Localization (Interface Translation)</H1>
		<P>The languages files must be created inside the "editor/lang" directory of the
			project. You can use the file <STRONG>en.js</STRONG> as the base file for your
			translations. The file names respect the <A href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3066.html" target="_blank">
				RFC 3066</A> <STRONG></STRONG>standards (but in lowercase). So, for
			example, a file for the <STRONG>Portuguese language</STRONG> should be called <STRONG>pt.js</STRONG>.</P>
		<P>Translation could also be localized for a specific country. In this case, for
			example, a Brazilian Portuguese translation file should be called <STRONG>pt-br.js</STRONG>.</P>
		<P>The clients language auto detection system uses the first available language
			that best fits the client settings. For example, if a client computer is set to
			Brazilian Portuguese and there is no pt-br.js file available, the pt.js is used
			if available. If not, the default language is used (from the&nbsp;configuration
			file).</P>
		<P>When creating new language files, you need to add an entry for it in the
			"edit/lang/fcklanguagemanager.js" file. Something like this:<BR>
			<BR>
			<code>FCKLanguageManager.AvailableLanguages =
				<BR>
				{<br>
				<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px">
					en : 'English',<BR>
					<STRONG>pt : 'Portuguese'</STRONG> </BLOCKQUOTE>}
				<BR>
			</code>
		<p>
			An important thing is to save the files in a <STRONG>UTF-8</STRONG> encoded
			format. In other case, some strange characters could appear instead of some
			special chars, like accented letters, symbols, etc.
		</p>
		<P>All translated files must be sent by e-mail to <A href="mailto:fredck@fckeditor.net">
				fredck@fckeditor.net</A>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;published in our "<A href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=75348&amp;atid=543655" target="_blank">Patches
				Tracker</A>" on Sourceforge for availability to other users.
		</P>
		<P>
			Before starting a new translation, please take a look at our web site (<A href="http://www.fckeditor.net/Developers/" target="_blank">http://www.fckeditor.net/Developers/</A>)
			and check if there is no translator assigned to your language. It&nbsp;is a
			good practice to contact FredCK (using the same address) asking if the
			translation was not yet started by another person.
		</P>
