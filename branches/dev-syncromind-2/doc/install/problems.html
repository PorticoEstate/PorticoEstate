				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					<b>First read, check and understand the 
					<a href="../php-configuration.html">PHP Configuration documentation</a></b>
				</p>
				<p>
					A collection of problems from users that cover a wide variety of subjects 
					(many having nothing to do with phpgroupware)
				</p>
				</p>
					If you decide to post to the <a href="http://support.phpgroupware.org/lists">mailing
					lists</a> or <a href="http://support.phpgroupware.org">the irc forum</a> with
					a problem, please include the name and version number of:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>name and version of your webserver (on redhat/fedora/mandrake the default 
						webserver is apache, get the version rpm -qa | grep httpd)</li>
					<li>name and version of your database (on redhat etc rpm -qa | grep mysql 
						or rpm -qa | grep postgresql)</p>
					<li>version of php (on redhat etc rpm -qa | grep php)</li>
					<li>version of phpgw (the login-box gives u the version and it 
						might also be on the bottom of other screens), and 
						the source of the version</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We're just adding to these as they come up .. so be patient
				</p>
				<p>
					Before posting double check that you have 
					<b>READ AND FOLLOWED THE PREVIOUS SECTIONS OF THIS DOCUMENT !!</b>
				</p>
				<h3>PHP</h3>
				<p>
					most people can get apache and php installed but many people 
					then run into problems
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>php pages display as source code .. look into the php 
						settings you should have in httpd.conf</li>
					<li>make sure you have installed php-imap (you need php-imap 
						in order to connect to an imap server from php) and php-pgsql 
						and php-mysql (you need one of these in order to connect to 
						your database server) if you intend to use any of 
						them (they're usually separate software packages)</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Email</h3>
				<p>
					System setup for Email gets so many problems that it gets it's 
					own section: <a href="http://docs.phpgroupware.org/app-email-faq">email-FAQ</a>.
					Here's some general info to get you started.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>imap and pop3 is for recieving, smtp is for sending</li>
					<li>can't send or can't receive. Before you do anything else, 
						please check your server settings in Admin, Email, Site Configuration 
						and also try to use email through another email client program</li>
					<li>small size limit on email (0.5 MB). For apache 2 and up, there is a 
						setting in php.conf that says LimitRequestBody 524288 which is 
						512k, change it to a higher size (for 8meg LimitRequestBody 8388608) 
						and restart your apache webserver</li>
					<li>email app folder list includes .dot files in my home directory. 
						Look into your imap setup and make sure your email server 
						is putting you email in a subdir of your home directory, not your 
						home directory itself</li>
					<li>sometimes I get Variable passed to each() error on 
						class.mail_dcom_imap_sock.inc.php, and sometimes it works 
						fine - socket support isn't finished, install php-imap</li>
				</ul>
