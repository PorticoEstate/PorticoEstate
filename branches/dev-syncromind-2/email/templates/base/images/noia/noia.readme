HISTORY
These icons are initially released for Microsoft WindowsXP and received much praise from the start. Therefore, i created 3 more variations.
With these icons i obtained the 1st place in the Axialis Contest in July, 2002.
I like having alternatives, therefore a long time ago (and lots of times) to install Linux on my x86 computers, without success. However, recently, Using Suse 8.0 I was able to succesful install Linux on my computer! I like Linux, it is a very powerful operating system and KDE is a nice desktop wich is rapidly being improved.
Due to nature of Linux and thanks to the thousands of people who have contributed their work to it, surely my icon set will become old soon :p
Finally, on November 7 2002 i finished my first icon set for KDE: The Noia icons.
Differences between Windows & KDE Noia icons:
-All icons actualized (the shadows weren't OK before)
-Higher sizes ;)
-The icons looks good on 16 bits modes :)) (I know, this is a KDE advantage, WIndowsXP don't shows correctly the 8bits alphablended icons on 16bits screen modes)
-The devices icons are 50% new for this version
-The filesystem icons are 90% new for this version
-The mimetyps icons are 99% new for this version
-The actions icons are 99% new for this version
-The application icons are entirelly new for this version
-Most importantly: THIS VERSION COVERS ALL (or almost all) OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM! I've haven't been able to do this on Windows or MAc OSX. This is really COOL!!

ICON DESCRIPTIONS
This is a icon set for KDE 3. I used 'the 'hilight' icons as a template, but initially i didn't release all of the icons. The final version will cover all 'hilight' icons except specific application icons (such math, midi etc.)
All icons are 32 bits, anti-aliased, and they have shadows and transparencies.
I tried to make my icons as original i could, unfortunately i had to use some concepts from other OSes and desktops.
All designs have been created by me and some of them are very original, at least on my opinion ;)
The result of my work is afresh, comic, clean, unique and modern set of icons.
I used Ulead Photoimpact 7. Ok, this is a program that only turns on the Windows Operative System... hopefully the Wine developers will soon allow me to run it under Linux instead.

WISHES
I call for your collaboration to complete this project. When it is finished, i will release different styles of the theme and some icons apart (for applications, and generics, not covered by KDE).
Please sent me your opinions, bug reports and suggestions to me (mail@carlitus.net).
If there are missing icons covered in KDE not yet present in this icon set, please let me know.
