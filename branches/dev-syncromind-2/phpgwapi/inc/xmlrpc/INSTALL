XMLRPC for PHP

Requirements
------------

The following requirements should be met prior to using 'XMLRPC for PHP': 
. PHP 5.1.0 or later
. the php "curl" extension is needed if you wish to use SSL or HTTP 1.1 to
  communicate with remote servers

The php "xmlrpc" native extension is not required, but if it is installed,
there will be no interference with the operation of this library.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Installation of the library is quite easy:

1. copy the contents of the lib/ folder to any location required by your
   application (it can be inside the web server root or not).

2. make sure your app can include those files. This can be achieved by setting
   the PHP include path, either in the php.ini file or directly in the php code
   of your application, using the 'set_include_path' function


Example of php code allowing an application to import the library:

set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/path/to/phpxmlrpc/lib/');
require_once( 'xmlrpc.inc' );
require_once( 'xmlrpcs.inc' );
require_once( 'xmlrpc_wrappers.inc' );


Please note that usage of the 'make' command for installation of the library is
not recommended, as it will generally involve editing of the makefile for a
succesfull run.
