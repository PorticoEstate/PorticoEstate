I'm pleased to announce XML-RPC for PHP version 1.0 beta 7. This is
fixes some critical bugs that crept in. If it shows itself to be stable
then it'll become the 1.0 release.

Comprehensive documentation is available in the distribution, but you
can also browse it at http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/doc/

Bugfixes in this release include:

 * Passing of booleans should now work as expected
 * Dollar signs and backslashes in strings should pass OK
 * addScalar() now works properly to append to array vals

New features include:

 * Added support for HTTP Basic authorization through the 
   xmlrpc_client::setCredentials method.

 * Added test script and method for verifying correct passing of
	 booleans
