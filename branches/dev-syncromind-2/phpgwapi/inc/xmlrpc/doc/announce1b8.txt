I'm pleased to announce XML-RPC for PHP version 1.0 beta 8. 

This release fixes several bugs and adds a couple of new helper
functions. The most critical change in this release is that you can no
longer print debug info in comments inside a server method -- you must
now use the new xmlrpc_debugmsg() function.

It can be downloaded from http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/php.html

Comprehensive documentation is available in the distribution, but you
can also browse it at http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/doc/

Bugfixes in this release include:

 * fixed whitespace handling in values
 * correct sending of Content-length from the server

New features include:

 * xmlrpc_debugmsg() method allows sending of debug info in comments in
   the return payload from a server

 * xmlrpc_encode() and xmlrpc_decode() translate between xmlrpcval
   objects and PHP language arrays. They aren't suitable for all
   datatypes, but can speed up coding in simple scenarios. Thanks to Dan
   Libby for these.

Please test this as hard as possible and report bugs to the XML-RPC PHP
mailing list, of which more details are available at
http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/list.html, or to <xmlrpc@usefulinc.com>.
