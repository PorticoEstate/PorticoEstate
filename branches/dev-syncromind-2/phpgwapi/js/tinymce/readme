This is the development version of tinymce to make it easier for us to build on tinymce.
All modifications to the code must be made in the classes and must be noted so they 
don't get lost during upgrades.

we have moved somethings around so it works properly with phpgw, sorry - skwashd

Here is where everything now lives compared to upstream:

/tinymce/ - moved to tinymce/other/ (confused?)
/tinymce/docs/ - moved to tinymce/other/docs/
/tinymce/examples/ - moved to tinymce/other/examples
/tinymce/jscripts/ - dropped
/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/ - moved to here

Hope this makes it easier for experienced tinymce users to adapt
