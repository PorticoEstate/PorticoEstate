phpGroupWare desktop template
Written by Dave Hall 

This template started off as an attempt to show what is possible with web 
based groupware.  Unfortunately the technology still has a bit of a way to
go so it is now just a basic XHTML1trans/CSS2/JS template which optimises 
screen real estate.  The layout is loosely based gnome.

Please refer to the TODO file in this directory for more info on what I
plan to do with this template set.

The icons used in the template are mostly from the gnome gorilla theme, 
developed by Jakub 'Jimmac' Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com> (they are all GPL).
The phpGroupWare images are modified versions of images produced by ov-media.
The title bar comes from the Crux metacity theme, by Anders Carlsson 
<andersca@gnu.org> - Copyright 2000 Eazel Inc.  The about icon is the stock
gnome about icon :)  There are also some random bits I found in the 
phpGroupWare CVS tree.
