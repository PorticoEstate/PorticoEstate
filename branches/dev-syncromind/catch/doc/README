Some information on how to make it work.

* Install trough setup
* Grant Admin access to the application
* Within the admin section of the application - grant the admin user (or group) access to the submodules
* The "entity" 1 is reserved for user/device configuration
* Start defining your shemas at "entity" 2 - installed as "Shema type 1"
* Config pickup-path and where to import the data in admin->catch->config
* Config valid devices as users at catch->Users and devices
* copy the property/inc/cron/default/catch_ppc to the cron-directory for your domain if other than "default"
* The import prosess kan run as cron job or from within the property-admin-section:
 1) as cron (modify to your environment):
   /usr/local/bin/php -q /_path_to_phpgroupware_/property/inc/cron/cron.php <domain> catch_ppc
   
   IMPORTANT!!  - the cron job has to be run by the apache user in order to organise attachments
   
 2) from admin->property->admin async services:
 	add a function:
 	  name: property.custom_functions.index
 	  data: function=catch_ppc
 	  descr: Import data to the catch module
 	Once the record is saved - you can do a right click and a "run now"
