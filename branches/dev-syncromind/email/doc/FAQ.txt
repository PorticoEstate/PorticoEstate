Q: I'm composing mail, what do I put in the "To" and/or "CC" boxes
A: The easiest was is to follow these examples,
   pay close attention to the spaces, do not add spaces you do not see here:
johndoe@example.com
johndoe@example.com,jane@example.com,tarzan@example.com
"John Doe" <johndoe@example.com>
"John Doe" <johndoe@example.com>,"Jane" <jane@example.com>
johndoe@example.com,"Jane" <jane@example.com>,tarzan@example.com


Q: I use UWash IMAP, where will phpgroupware email look for MBOX files?
A1: The mbox folder "INBOX" will always be available by default
A2: (The following answer is subject to change when this option becomes
    settable suring the system wide setup)
-IF your mbox files are in $HOME/mail (a.k.a. ~/mail/*) then you do NOT
 need to change any settings, email will look there BY DEFAULT.
-IF your mbox folders (such as the "Sent" and "Trash" foldsers)
 are in any other location (such as your $HOME directory, a.k.a ~/*)
 THEN you must _currently_ set the following "custom option"
 FOR EACH ACCOUNT (this will change when this option becomes a system item).
--FIRST do this:
 - goto the "Preferences" page
 - click on "E-Mail preferences"
 - check "use custom settings"
 - enter these next items ONLY if they are different from your account
   and system defaults:
   - enter your email account name, password, and your email address
   - enter the name or IP address of your IMAP server (ex: mail.example.com)
   - choose IMAP as your "mail server type"
   - choose "UWash" as your "imap server type"
 - the last option is presently called "UWash Mail Folder"
   ( it used to be called "Mail Folder(uw-maildir)"
     this option will works for regular UWash IMAP and UWash Maildir IMAP)
 - If your mbox files are in $HOME   then LEAVE THIS OPTION BLANK.
 - If your mbox files are in $HOME/email  then type in this:
email
(notice NO QUOTES, NO TILDES, NO SLASHES)
 - If your mbox files are in $HOME/mystuff  then type in this:
mystuff
(notice NO QUOTES, NO TILDES, NO SLASHES)
 - If your mbox files are in $HOME/data/email  then type in this:
data/email
(notice NO QUOTES, NO TILDES, and you see the slash in the middle)
 - In the rare event you need to use a slash as seen above, then of course,
   forward slash is used in Linux type systems, and backslash typically 
   for M-S installations.
 - then click "Submit"
Note: As of this writting, it is a "per user" config option only


Q: I can not attach files to an email, I get errors about "unlink".
A: There are 2 directories to check:
 - goto /setup  (the phpgroupware initial setup page)
 - login to "Setup/Config Admin Log"
 - in "Step 2 - Configuration" click "Edit Current Configuration"
 - under "Path Information" see the box labeled
   "Enter full path for temporary files: Examples: /tmp, C:\TEMP"
 - what you entered in this box will be the first place to look
   on Linux systems, say you enter this
/var/phpgw
   then that directory *could* be (user.group perms) webserver.webserver 0700
   I say *could* because the exact security configuration is beyond
   the scope of this FAQ. What is needed is that the directory you 
   enter in that box should exist and have permissions that allow the 
   web server to read and write files and create directories.
 - The other directory to check is the temporary directory
   that your web server typically uses, but the information listed
   above is by far the most common config issue with email attachments.


Q: My imap server logs show many login attempts with garbage usernames, why?
A: At this time, we know this happens when, for this option:
"Enter your POP/IMAP mail server hostname or IP address"
   if you enter this:
localhost
   then this problem seems to occur. For now the solution would be to try
   the actual IP or the machine name (resolvable via DNS, hosts,
   or other means) for your IMAP email server.
