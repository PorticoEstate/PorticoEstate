Adding Files, Directories and Icons:
------------------------------------

As with any normal phpGW application, the Folders View has the recommended directory structure. It is downloadable at

http://www.probusiness.de/projekte/phpgroupware/

as a compressed zipped file (Tar Ball) containing the necessary files and directories. When expanded/ unzipped under the phpGW root directory, the tarball will expand appropriately. Unzip the zip archive to the root of your installation.
