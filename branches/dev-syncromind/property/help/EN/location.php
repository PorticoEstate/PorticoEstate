		A metadatabase keeps track of dynamic configurable location hierarchy - which is configurable in both width and depth - that is: one can define as many levels as one like - and each level can also have as many attributes as one would like.<p/>

		The location hierarchy is linked with foreign keys with - and querying a certain level generates a query with proper join statements to the top of the hierarchy. The sql-query is stored in a cache table for later use.<p/>
