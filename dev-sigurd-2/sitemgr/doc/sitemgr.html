>Sitemgr builds web sites from templates. Those are stored in the directory sitemgr/sitemg-site/templates. Each of them has a directory of its own. The file main.tpl defines the template of the whole site, there can be other files that define code for separate areas of the page or for specific modules. Templates contain four kinds of variables. These are explained here since the types 2,3,4 and 5 can be used both in the template as in the page content a module generates.
   </P

>{modulename(?arguments)}These let you hardcode a call to a module into a template. Arguments are in the HTTP GET query string syntax (?key1=value1&#38;key2=value2). At the moment, if you use this type of variables, you have to urlencode the query string yourself. Future versions of sitemgr might provide a simpler notation. For example,{lang_block] creates the select box for multilingual sites.

>Links to sitemgr either start with '?sitemgr:' or only with '?'. You can either link to a page with {?page_name=downloads] and [?page_id=4}, to a category's index (?category_id=5), to the site index (?index), to the site's table of contents (?toc). Just [?] or {?sitemgr:} links to the administrator defined home page.
     </P

NAME="AEN42">Module</H3
><P
>The main function of a sitemgr module is to generate dynamic web site content. To make the development of new modules, and the use of modules easy and convenient, sitemgr defines an &#8220;abstract&#8221; class module which each module should extend. This parent of all modules, provides one essential service: It hooks the module into the content managment interface and permits the editing of the module's arguments that determine what content will be generated. Thus in order to create a new module, all you have to do, is to extend the abstract super module, define the modules arguments, and write a get_content function that returns the content that should be displayed on the website.

NAME="AEN46">Argument/Content</H3
><P
>A module can be seen as a transformation of input arguments into generated content. It is important to understand that the input arguments can be of completely different kinds. On the one hand there can be arguments that are as close as possible to the generated content. For example the html module's only argument is named &#8220;htmlcontent&#8221; and in normal circumstances it is not transformed at all but handed over as is to the page generation engine. On the other hand arguments can play any conceivable role in the generation of content that is driven by data coming from other phpgroupware applications. They can be used to select between different categories of content, they can choose a certain format of presentation, they can function as search terms, etc.

>A module can define properties. Properties are accessible to the modules get_content function in the same way as arguments, but they differ from them in two ways:
   </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Properties are edited by the site administrator. Their intended role is to put certain constrains on the workings of the module, so that a site administrator can enforce certain rules. For example the standard html module defines a property called striphtml. If this boolean property is set the module replaces all html in the generated content with entities.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Properties are not defined with respect to a certain generated content block, but are defined either on a site-wide level or on the level of specific categories. Additionally you can differenciate on each scope properties for each content area. When a content block is generated, properties are searched for in a cascading way, i.e. when the block is specific to a specific page and contentarea and the module's properties are not defined for the combination of the contentarea and the page's category, then properties defined for higher scopes are looked for in a certain order.

><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>A template can contain hardcoded calls to modules that will generate content visible on each page. Thus you could put dynamic content that is visible across the whole site on a place of its own directly into the template. But beware that restrictions defined by the administrator also apply to these hardcoded module calls.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A template defines several content areas. This is one important differenced between the modularized sitemgr and previous versions where there were was only one place where contributor edited content went (page_content) and two places for administrator configured blocks (right_blocks, left_blocks). Now templates can define any practical number of content areas with arbitrary names. And there is no more much difference between central and peripheric areas. All can show administrator and contributor provided block content.With one exeption: The name &#8220;center&#8221; is special in that special pages that get generated by special URLs like &#8220;?toc&#8221; and &#8220;?index&#8221; or &#8220;?category_id=number&#8221; always put there page content (which is internally generated by nothing else than a module) into this content area. If your template does not have a content area called &#8220;center&#8221; these special URLs won't work.
Content areas can display module output, as edited by the page's contributors. We refer to each output of a module as a block. Here is another important difference to how sitemgr used to work: Until now there was a sharp distinction between page content which replaces the template variable page_content, and side blocks which got defined in a special file called blockconfig and replaced the template varialbes right_blocks and left_blocks. Now from the perspective of the page generation engine there is no more any difference between content areas, all display blocks of content generated by modules.
The blocks one content area displays can be defined on different levels of scope: There are site wide blocks that are visible across the whole site, category wide blocks, that are visible on pages that belong to the category or any of its children, and finally are page blocks that define what distinguishes the page from other pages, and normally will be that what you'd call the page's main content.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The block content generated by a module can contain template variables of the same type as those that can be hardcoded. This is mostly useful for modules like the html module, where the contributor specified argument is nearly identical to the generated content. Thus a contributor can embed module calls inside the content of a certain block. This is done only once without any recursion, i.e. if a embedded module call returns itself a template variable it is not parsed and processed again.

This allows for working on several changes to the website and viewing them in a draft mode, before commiting them all at once to the production site. Sitemgr distinguishes five states for versions:

NAME="AEN94">Transformer</H3
><P
>The architecture for sitemgr modules provides for the distinction between some form of raw content a module produces and the way it should get displayed on the web site, with the future possibility to plug other display types into the same framework. The idea is that the raw content of a module gets passed through different transformers, possibly even several transformers in a sequence at the time of content generation. Additionally this provides for a use of modules outside of sitemgr, for example remote retrieval of information with something like XML-RPC. 
   </P
><P
>At the moment, a module does not need to use transformers on its own, it can directly generate html content, but if it does, sitemgr provides for an easy way to chain different transformers together. Thus a module can be constructed in different layers of functionality. For example a module's get_content function could return data in XML, and it defines a XSLT transformation to reorganize this data, and a second transformer for creating a user interface for display.
   </P
><P
>Transformers are also used on the level of the site template, insofar as each contentarea can have an associated transformer, which wraps the different content blocks into a common display format. This does the same thing as the file sideblock.tpl in former versions of sitemgr.

>Sitemgr in its new modularized architecture continues to be fully multilingual. It is very simple to have a new module use this feature. All that is needed is to use a special flag in the definition of the module's arguments. All arguments that have this flag will be stored in a language specific database table, and can be translated in the translation manager, very similar to the way category and page definitions could already be translated to several languages.

The first select box and its adjacent button in each row permits to choose lists of permitted modules. The first row defines a master list for the whole site which is used when no more specific lists are found for content areas or categories. The following rows each pertain to the different content areas of your site template. Here you can choose to allow some modules for one content areas, and other modules for another one.
In the category manager, there is a button &#8220;Manage Modules&#8221; associated with each category. There you can use the same interface to define lists specific to one category (and all its subcategories, unless overriden). Again you have the choice between one list that pertains to all content areas, and specific lists for each category.
When sitemgr has to find a specific value of permitted lists in a given context (a given contentarea in a given category) the following algorithm is used: First it aks for a value defined for the pair contentarea/category. If none is defined, it climbs up the category hierarchy until the site wide value, each time looking for a value defined for the pair contentarea/category. If none can be found, it returns to the given category the search started from, and now asks for values defined for the given category but independent from the contentarea. If there is still none defined, it repeats the same traversal up the category hierarchy. This means that by simply defining one global master list of permitted modules, you can configure the whole site, if you do not need more fine grained control.
The lists of permitted lists are never merged, if you define one list for a given context, this list is used in this context.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define module properties: The lookup algorithm for module properties is exactly the same as for the lists of permitted modules. For each module you can set properties for the whole site, for content areas, for categories, or for combinations of content areas and categories. You access the property editor from the same page where you choose the list of permitted modules. You just use the second select box in each row. By selecting one module and clicking the &#8220;Configure module properties&#8221; button, you will open a interface for editing the module's properties which ressembles the interface for editing module arguments in the content manager. Be aware that only some modules define properties.

All other contentareas can have arbitrary names, and you can have any practical number of them.

>A contentarea serves to display the content blocks, the site administrator and contributors define. Each contentarea can have its own way of wrapping html code around each content block. This at the moment defined in a class that implements the transformer interface, i.e. defines a function apply_transform($title,$content).This class' name is areaname_bt (for blocktransformer) and it is stored in file areaname_bt.inc.php inside the template directory. The function apply_transform just has to wrap the desired html around the content. It is free to ignore the title, for example the block title does not necessarily make sense in a page's central content area. A block transformer could apply other transformations to the content, but this would probably have counter-intuitive effects on your page's contributors<A

>Other than that a template directory can contain template files that are specific to a certain module. For example the news module uses a file newsblock.tpl which is a standard API template. It is up to a module's developpers what kind of templates he wants to use. We propose to use a namespace for these module specific template files. For example a template used by module 'news' would go into a subdirectory 'modules/news' in each template directory. If the module does not find a template it needs in the site template's directory, it should look for a default template file, for example in &#8220;default/modules/news'.

><P
>This is the function every module needs. It produces the module's content. It is passed two arrays, one with the arguments for the block the module is generating, and the other with the properties that apply for the block's context. At the moment there is no constraint on what type of date the get_content function returns. It can be html, xml, an array, etc. But if it does not return html, you have to provide a transformer capable to produce html from the data get_content produces. The arguments are passed as a reference, because the get_content function can change them, and they can get stored automatically as session variable. This is because the parent module provides one other service: Your module can rely on an automatic handling of HTTP GET, POST and COOKIE variables, and of session variables. All you'd have to do is to define the arrays $this-&#62;get, $this-&#62;post, $this-&#62;cookie and $this-&#62;session. All members of these variables will be fetched from the GET, POST or COOKIE parameters, or from session variables and stored for you in the $arguments array. The entries of $this-&#62;session additionnaly will be stored after get_content returns to get_output. This can be very useful if you want your module to remain in a stable state while the user interacts with other modules on the same page.
   </P
><P
>The variables you define in these arrays can be identical to those in $this-&#62;arguments. In this case, if they are defined in the HTTP session context, they will override the values the page contributor has defined for the page. But they can be different variables that do not need an initial value provided by the page contributor. Whereas $this-&#62;get,$this-&#62;cookie and $this-&#62;session are simple arrays enumerating the variable names, $this-&#62;post is special because it can contain the element definition in the same way as $this-&#62;arguments, which can be used to programatically construct the form elements.
  </P
><P
>Your module does not need to use this service, it could directly read HTTP variables. The advantage of using it is that it provides a namespace for each module, so that if different modules that use the same variable names are used on the same page, no problems occur. If you use this service you can construct URLS automatically with the modules link function (see below), and if you construct the user interface, you have to provide the correct form element names for this service to work. The build_post_element function can help you do this. For example lets extend our hello module, so that the site user can choose his own name. Since we can no longer rely on the validation that is automatically done on contributor provided input. we call validate from the get_content function.
