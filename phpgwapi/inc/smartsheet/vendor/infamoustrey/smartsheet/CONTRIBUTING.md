# Contributing to this project

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. The idea is full api coverage! If it doesn't fit that description provide a good description why you think it should be added anyway! We're open to new ideas!

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests (patches, improvements, new features) are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

## Using the issue tracker

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Infamoustrey/smartsheet/issues) is the preferred channel
for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).

Please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (email
  [treybfoster@gmail.com](mailto:treybfoster@gmail.com)).

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Security Issues

Please send all security issues to Trey Foster at [treybfoster@gmail.com](mailto:treybfoster@gmail.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Demonstrate the problem** &mdash; provide clear steps that can be reproduced.

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experienced the
problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help
to fix any potential bugs.
