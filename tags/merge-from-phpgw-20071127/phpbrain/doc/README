KNOWN ISSUES
----
SQL error when searching using mySQL:
Symptom: 
Database error: Invalid SQL: SELECT *, MATCH text,keywords,title AGAINST('something') AS score FROM phpgw_kb_faq WHERE published = 1 ORDER BY score DESC
MySQL Error: 1191 (Can't find FULLTEXT index matching the column list)
File: /path/to/phpgroupware/phpbrain/inc/class.sokb.inc.php

Cause:
The FULLTEXT index has not be created on the phpgw_kb_faq table.  This is a limitation of the phpgw db setup tools.  You must create the index manually.

Fix:
Run this in mySQL
ALTER TABLE phpgw_kb_faq ADD FULLTEXT(text,keywords,title);
