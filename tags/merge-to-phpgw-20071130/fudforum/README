The following is a brief explanation of how the FUDforum installer works and
what is necessary for it's correct operation.

Inside the setup/ directory, which are you currently in there is file called
'index.php'. When FUDforum is being installed this file will be copied from
setup/ to fudforum/ directory where it will temporary assume the role of
FUDforum's index page. When the forum is accessed for the 1st time this file
will perform the necessary actions to complete the forum installation and 
upon successful completion redirect you to the forum's front page. The primary
purpose of this file is to copy various forum files from base/ into 
files/fudforum/ directory. This is necessary to allow FUDforum to perform the
necessary disk writes needed for normal operation. The file will also need to
create several files inside the web browseable fudforum/ directory. This will
require you to grant write permissions to the web-server to several files 
(installer will complain about them, if they are not writable) and directories.
The simplest solution is to temporary chmod fudforum/ directory 777 and then
restore to normal permissions once the installation process is complete.

If you wish to save a few megabytes of space, once the forum is installed
you can remove the base/ directory, it is no longer needed.

By default FUDforum will disallow anonymous user access, if you wish to enable
it, create an anonymous user in phpGroupWare and then in FUDforum's admin control
panel enter that user's Login & Password into Anonymous Username & Anonymous 
Password fields. Once that is done, anonymous users will be able to access the 
forum. To control the abilities of anonymous users, use the FUDforum permissions
system. By default anonymous users will only be able to view & search the forums.
