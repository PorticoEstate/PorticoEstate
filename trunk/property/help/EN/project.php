	<li><b>Project management:</b><p/>
		A project is a collection of orders/contracts. The project is linked to a location or entity (e.g equipment). Projects is separated in orders/contracts that could be subject to bidding contest amongst vendors. Each order is linked to its parent project and to a vendor - and consists of a series of work-descriptions to perform and / or items to deliver. An order can be defined as simple as a brief description of simple tasks - or as a detailed complex tender document with a full blown deviation auditing system up per record in the contract.<p/>

		When calculating an order - one can either choose elements from the prizebook, or add custom entries.<p/>

		A typical order can be saved as a template for later re-use.<p/>

		Orders is sent by email to vendors - which in return sends the invoice (also on email)<p/>
